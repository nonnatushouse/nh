00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,799
MATURE JENNIFER: We would give
children anything at Christmas...

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,799
..their passing fancies
or their hearts' desires,

3
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,239
their frenzied crazes
or the things they yearn for.

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,639
We want to fill their hands
because it fills our hearts.

5
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,799
That is the secret
of grown-ups everywhere.

6
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,959
Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry. Sorry!

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,519
Vi!

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,079
This is a bit of
a quick turnaround, Fred.

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,680
I mean, what are you going to do if
any of the children recognise you?

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,999
I'm just going to have
to fall back on the truth

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and tell them
I'm one of his helpers!

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,399
Fred!

Mummy!

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
Oh! There's my girl!

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,839
Now, what do you say to Auntie Vera?

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
Thank you for looking after me
for so long.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Oh! Make sure you come and see me.

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,120
She will. We both will.

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
Happy Christmas.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,920
Come on, Mummy!
NANCY CHUCKLES

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,399
Happy Christmas to you, too!

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,920
Good lad. Good lads, come on.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,840
Good afternoon, Fred!

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,600
Afternoon, Sister...

26
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,360
THEY CHEER

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,279
Mummy! It's even got a kettle,
just as Sister Veronica promised.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,239
It was a duplicate wedding present.

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,359
Oh! There's also an alarm clock.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,999
Also a...duplicate wedding present.
THEY CHUCKLE

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,999
So you can get up early
and make your mother a cup of tea!

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,839
Sister Julienne, I can't
thank you enough for all of this.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,559
Once we had persuaded you
to stay with us,

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,919
it was the only living arrangement
that seemed to make sense.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,319
One can only marvel
that it was not thought of sooner!

36
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,039
Indeed.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,999
And that was my omission.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,999
KNOCKING ON DOOR
MAN: You've had the eviction notice.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,959
I don't like the look of that.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,319
Mr Aylward?
BANGING ON DOOR

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,359
I'd thought the bailiffs
would have been and gone by now.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,959
There's a lady in the basement
of number 11 who's being moved

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,599
to a geriatric hospital.
It's taken all afternoon

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,319
to persuade her out of her armchair.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,159
All cellar dwellings are to be
evacuated and boarded up.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,879
Those rooms are structurally unsafe.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,400
I only found out we owned these
a few months ago.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,319
I'm not leaving till I've seen
Nigel! Who's Nigel, Mrs Sleaman?

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,359
If you give me a telephone number,
perhaps I can call him for you.

50
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,719
He's a cat. He was down there
all along. Nearly had me eye out!

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,839
Ohhh! Oh, bless you.
Oh, you're a good boy, aren't you?

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,999
I don't think he's any more keen
to leave than you are.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,519
We've been through
some times together.

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,400
NIGEL MEOWS

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,319
If ever you're passing...

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,240
..he wouldn't say no
to a tin of pilchards.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,479
Sir! Erm, can I leave this with you?
I've left Jonty sitting in the car.

58
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,600
Of course. You must go. Thank you.

Good evening, Nurse Crane.

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,079
Just my usual evening call
of inquiry!

64
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,119
We've had no births on the district
as yet today.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,879
And it is Nurse Aylward's second day
back at work after her honeymoon.

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,799
This morning we spent 25 minutes...
DOOR OPENS, LAUGHTER

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,239
..looking at wedding photographs
in the clinical room.

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,999
If I hadn't been sent
on this infernal refresher course,

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,199
she could have had longer off!

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,759
Indeed. But refresher courses,
however ill-timed, have their uses.

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,559
We must have every credential
in order

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,679
before the trainee midwives arrive
in March.

73
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
And March will be upon us
before we know it.

74
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,960
I've a few new thoughts
for my list of concerns. Mm.

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,719
Please, Mr Sharma! If you don't open
the door, we'll have to force entry,

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,919
and I don't want to have to do that.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,999
You will force nothing!
This is my home!

I know this is your home.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,919
But all these cellar dwellings
have to be boarded up.

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,960
The electricity and water
have already been disconnected.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
You called me sir...

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,999
..and I shall do so likewise.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,439
Sir...I am leaving of my own accord.

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,239
No enforcement is required.

88
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,799
Do you have somewhere to go?

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000

Ugh!

You can "ugh" all you like,

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,519
but it's one of the most popular
items in the Christmas Club boxes.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,919
People tick the forms for either...
asparagus or sherry consomme,

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,679
a coconut or a pineapple.

CHILDREN: Hello! Happy Christmas!
Hello!

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,839
What can I do for you, Mrs Turner?
The children were wondering

103
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,879
if there was anything
in tonight's papers about Apollo 8.

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,399
Not half!
The Gazette's full of it again.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,799
You would have thought
they were launching it from Poplar,

106
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,159
not from Florida! Can I please have
some glue for my scrapbook?

107
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,639
Yes, treacle, it's just down there,

108
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,559
on that stand in front of
the comics. I've never seen a child

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,999
so besotted with the space race!

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,599
Her teacher has promised her
house points

111
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,039
if she takes the scrapbook in
after Christmas.

112
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,999
I reckon it's a nice thing
for them to be mad about.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,559
I mean, what else have they got
to watch on telly, eh?

114
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,319
Biafra. Oh! Don't even get me
started on that Blue Peter appeal!

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,839
I've sent two parcels
of old clothes off already.

116
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,239
Aw!

117
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,519
Here, you can have the paper
on the house. Oh, thank you!

118
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,519
The glue will be a shilling.

119
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,079
Of course it is.

In we pop.

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,759
Your obsession
with giving things away

126
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,519
is going to be the death of me.

127
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,559
Or very possibly this business!

128
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,919
Oh, have a heart, Vi! Reggie, go
and put the "closed" sign up.

129
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,559
And then I want you to help me hang
this notice up in the window.

130
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,719
What's all this, then?

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,919
For every ten Christmas Club boxes,

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,640
we are donating one free of charge
to a deserving local resident.

133
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,559
Just because I know about business

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,200
doesn't mean to say that I don't
know how to love my neighbour!

135
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,039
That's it! Thank you, Jonty.
Watch Daddy!

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,040
Oh! Beautiful!

SISTER MONICA JOAN: Now it's time
for our newest resident

139
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,399
to place her letter
to Father Christmas in the grate.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,319
I wrote "NEW ADDRESS" in capitals,
next to Nonnatus House.

141
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,360
AND underlined it,
so Santa doesn't get mixed up!

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,359
SISTER VERONICA: If we're lucky
and the elves come tonight,

143
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,519
it'll be on its way
to the North Pole by morning.

144
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,919
Timothy says
he wants driving gloves,

145
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,399
because
he's passed his driving test,

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,159

148
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,959
His money's run out. I don't think
Father Christmas brings records.

149
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,479
Hmm, I think you'll find his elves

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,119
are up-to-date
with ALL the modern trends.

151
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,079
He won't have a problem
with roller-skates for May

152
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,359
or a telescope for Angela, either.

153
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,560
How do you spell tortoise?

154
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,359
Father Christmas doesn't bring
tortoises.

155
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,599
It's too cold in the North Pole.

156
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I want a tortoise!

157
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,159
Is Colette asleep?
Out like a light.

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,279
Father Christmas hasn't collected
the letters from the fireplace yet.

159
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,159
I wondered if we might be forgiven

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,519
for taking a little peek
at what she's asked for.

161
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes!

162
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,120
She says...

163
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,479
"..Dear Father Christmas,

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,119
"I don't need any Christmas presents
this year..."

165
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,280
What? "..because
I have everything I want."

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
Aw!

167
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,440
Good morning, sir!

168
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,559
I don't think Mr Palmer opens
until nine.

169
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,880
I'm content to wait.
I require tools.

170
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,519
Our own kettle!

171
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,279
And our own key!

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,679
Put this on now. I've warmed it
through on the radiator.

173
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,639
SCOFFS
You're spoiling her, Sister!

174
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,319
She's going
to a hospital appointment!

175
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,719
Nasal cautery is not something
to be sniffed at!

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,199
But it IS going to put a stop
to all those horrid nosebleeds.

177
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,039
A tortoise, Patrick!

178
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,759
He wanted a pogo stick last week.

179
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,039
Too late! The letters have gone
to Father Christmas now.

180
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,679
I can't remember the last time
Miss Higgins let me have free rein

181
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,119
with the reception desk.
If she wasn't out

182
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,359
inspecting new clinic premises,
you wouldn't get anywhere near.

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,759
AS MISS HIGGINS:
This morning's surgery starts with

184
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,879
a double appointment.
Beckwith, mother and son.

185
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,759
A, menstrual disorder,
B, teething trouble, query eczema.

186
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,279
Then Mrs Brenda Shelby,
expectant mother of twins.

187
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,759
Yes, Brenda Shelby!

188
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,959
I'm looking forward to seeing her!

189
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,879
Ah. I HOPED she'd be under Mathers.
He's the top man in the field.

190
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,239
Clinic will commence
at two o'clock sharp every Tuesday.

191
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,079
The midwives and myself will require
ingress at precisely 1pm.

192
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,239
I don't think Knitting Club
will have finished by then.

193
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,839
Knitting Club will be obliged
to finish.

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,959
Our schedule of classes, including
mothercraft and relaxation,

195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,839
will make us
this hall's primary occupant...

196
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,999
..and your principal source
of income.

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,119
Now, we need to discuss

198
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,359
the aroma in the lavatories.

199
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,999
And in all those seven years,
did you not conceive even once?

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,839
We tried and we tried,

201
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,399
and we hoped and we hoped, but...

202
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,959
..nothing ever happened. It's hard
to explain how hard it was.

203
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,839
You don't have to. I do understand.

204
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,599
I'm one of eight kids.

205
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,759
When my sisters started getting
in the family way, I...

206
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,439
..I thought it would eat me alive.
That's why we moved away.

207
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,559
And this is why you've moved back.

208
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,479
There's nothing like having family
around you.

209
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
Even five years ago,

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,119
these fertility drugs were
still the stuff of dreams.

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,479
Last week, Mr Mathers brought
students in to look at me,

212
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,120
and he kept calling me
"the research subject"!

213
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,599
Brenda, the Royal College Hospital
have been with you

214
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,559
every step of the way on this.
According to Mr Mathers' notes,

215
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,359
they're going to admit you
well in advance of your due date.

216
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,839
Now, what we need to do is work out
a plan

217
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,239
for looking after you and the twins
once you all come home.

218
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,120
Oh! We've hardly thought about that,
have we, Vince?

Do you know,

220
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,839
I always get a bit giddy
every time I see a piece of tinsel.

221
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,839
Christmases were never
quite the same

222
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,319
at the branch house in Hong Kong.

223
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,799
Did you ever spend the season
overseas, Sister Monica Joan?

224
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,079
My mission has always been confined
to our home shores.

225
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,399
The Almighty willed it thus.

226
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,479
Oh, well, never say nev...

227
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,040
THIS...forthcoming Christmas...

228
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,479
..will be my last upon this Earth.

229
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,959
Sister! That is
a very doleful prediction.

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,000
It is not a prediction.

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,079
God has assured me of this grace.

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,359
I shall not see another
festive season this side of heaven.

233
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,279
And I accept his will.

234
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,279
You say that as if you've got
nothing left to live for.

235
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,000
I should not phrase it so bluntly...

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,959
..but the sentiment is not
inapposite.

237
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,039
What about the people
devoted to your care?

238
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,919
What about your Sisters...
and your friends?

239
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,839
What about man's incursion
into space?

240
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,479
You've followed that programme
for years.

241
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,159
Surely you want to live
to see man walking on the moon?

242
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,440
I fear...it does not impress.

243
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,799
Just as Apollo 8 will not impress.

244
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,520
Apollo 8 is going to go
round and round the moon, Sister!

245
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,040
The moon itself has circled
our petty planet for eternity.

246
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,920
I see no great virtue in
an American vehicle doing likewise.

And this will be my final Christmas.

250
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,319
We shall pray for you.

251
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
Pray that it will be a happy one.

Gosh! It's a...

254
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,119
..little early for a negligee.

255
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,679
It's a hostess gown. Oh? We have
a strenuous evening ahead of us.

256
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,840
Mm! Writing thank-you letters.

Oh, Matthew, come along!

Sit to the table.

260
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,599
I thought the bride did this. Well,
I'm sure she did traditionally,

261
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,840
but traditionally, she didn't have
a job that kept her out all day.

262
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,439
Fair enough. Shall I do my side
and you do your side?

263
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,039
No. I'll do your side
and you do my side.

264
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,359
It's more suggestive
of the union of two families.

265
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
Peace and goodwill towards all men,
lest we forget.

266
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,639
Is your mother still being difficult
about Christmas dinner?

267
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,439
Not, er, difficult.

268
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,839
Just...fragile. It's still so soon
after my father died.

269
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,079
I've told you, I don't mind going
to your mother's house at all,

270
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,599
as long as we can get to
Nonnatus House in time for pudding.

271
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,240
I just wanted something of our own,
Christmas done...

272
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,840
..our way.

273
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh, darling. And so many things will
be done our way, here, in our home.

274
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,319

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,439
I spent the entire taxi ride from
the nether reaches of Herne Hill

282
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,039
trying to think up
a witty conversational opener

283
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
along the lines of,
"Any room at the inn?"

284
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,399
Er, I thought
you were spending Christmas

285
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,799
with your friend, Bernard,
and his aunt.

286
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,200
Bernard's aunt has fallen ill.
Er, there's been a change of plan.

287
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,319
Do you think Nurse Crane will take
photographs this Christmas?

288
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,040
I don't doubt Nurse Crane will take
photographs into perpetuity.

289
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,759
And beyond. It's going to be
the best Christmas of my life.

290
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,279
I don't want it to vanish
from my mind.

291
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,839
The best Christmas of MY life
has never yet faded from mine.

292
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,999
What do you remember about it?

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,239
A knitted stocking
hanging from the bedstead,

294
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,039
containing a ragdoll,

295
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,959
an orange

296
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,479
and a Book Of Common Prayer.

297
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,599
Green garlands

SHE CHUCKLES

301
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,279
And there was a tableau
in the village church -

302
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,919
the shepherds and the magi,

303
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,879
a living ox,

304
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,279
a living ass...

305
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,200
..and the Christ Child.

306
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,840
Like a Nativity play?

307
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,680
Not the way
you would think of it now.

308
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,839
It was inspired
by a Flemish painting,

309
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,879
and it seemed
as though the infant himself

310
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,240
was the source of all the light.

311
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
I look back now...

312
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,280
..and it's as though it was painted
on glass and set with jewels.

313
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,960
I rode to church
in the pony chaise...

314
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,960
..with my mother.

315
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,880
And under the furs...

316
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,280
..her hand held mine.

317
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,240
I don't recall the touch of her,
ever, after that.

318
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,560
My mother holds my hand
all the time.

319
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,399
I was not so fortunate, perhaps.

320
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,760
But that day was miraculous
in everything it offered.

321
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,639
Oh,

322
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,240
if I could live
but...one hour of it again...

323
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,200
..I would die contented...

324
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
..with my soul replete.

325
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,839
CHILDREN: You did it yesterday! No,
May, it's not fair. It's MY turn.

326
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,159
It's my turn. You did it yesterday!
I can't hear the radio.

327
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,599

Er, can I beg for
half a grapefruit for my breakfast?

340
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,999
I don't have any grapefruit in,
Geoffrey! Not unless I'm slimming.

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,039
And you didn't bring any pyjamas.

00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,239
I lost all my smart pyjamas when
the Ormonde Hotel went up in flames.

343
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,159
I did get them back,
but the smell of smoke on the silk

344
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,519
was unendurable.

345
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,919
Besides, you have to admit
this is a top-quality singlet.

346
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,160
Geoffrey, is Bernard's aunt
really ill, or did you two quarrel?

347
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,919
Bernard is engaged to be married...

348
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,680
..to a hairdresser
from the salon on the cruise ship.

349
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,359
She's a nice little thing,
quite elegant.

350
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,159
Well, perhaps he can bring her out
to visit you in Malta.

351
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,000
Malta and I are "fini"! Why?

352
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,799
The expat community are dwindling by
the year. It's all tourists now,

353
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,959
and, of course, the Maltese.
But the long and the short of it

354
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,919
is that, er, nobody needs
an osteopath when they're on holiday

355
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,999
and I have a sniff of an opening
in Harley Street.

356
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,719
Oh, that sounds promising.

357
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,919
I simply need somewhere to stay
while I pursue it. I can pay rent.

358
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,119
In...in cash, or in kind. I can cook
and wrap Christmas presents.

359
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,640
There's no end to my talents,
really.

360
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,480
You can stay with us for as long
as you want, and well you know it.

361
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
Have you found yourself
a place to sleep yet?

362
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,160
Maybe a nice, warm shed?

363
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,399
Sir? I won't report you.

364
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,199
You are from the council. Mm.

365
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,479
Sometimes I have to do as I am told.

366
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,879
Sometimes I make my own decisions.

367
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,599
But I don't think this is the best
place for you to be living in.

368
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,040
Sometimes I make my own decisions,
also.

369
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,840
DOOR CLOSES

370
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,839
Absolutely everything appears
to be in order.

371
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,999
Sister, it wouldn't surprise me

372
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,999
if you saw us all lowered
into the ground.

373
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,079
Can you not remove this man?

374
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,760
He appears to be pleading the case
for eternal life!

375
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,240
She's suffering from depression.

376
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,079
It's common in the elderly
and often goes undiagnosed.

377
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,119
But...it can be very damaging.
Does she need to see a psychiatrist?

378
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,799
If she did, the recommendation
would be to steer her towards

379
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,759
the things that make her happy.

380
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,359
Reminiscence.

381
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
Attention.

382
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,319
A sense of being valued.

383
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,239
But we try so hard to give her
all those things.

384
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,880
What's reminiscence?

385
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,799
It's talking about the past,
but in a way that makes you happy.

386
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,839
Sister Monica Joan
reminisced with me last night.

387
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,320
And she stopped talking about dying.

388
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,679
Screens and couches
straight into position, please.

389
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,840
The floor has been marked
with chalk.

390
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,760
INAUDIBLE

391
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,640
INAUDIBLE

392
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,599
Mrs Shelby?

393
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,639
Sister Veronica, our health visitor,

394
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,599
will apprise you
of your entitlements.

395
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,279
Here are some leaflets to read
whilst you wait.

396
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,959
Do help yourself to refreshments.

397
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Oh, my mum's just getting me some.

398
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,959
Mince pies and everything!

399
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,680
Watch out, they've gone a bit mad
with the icing sugar.

400
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,119
You don't half look familiar.
You a Poplar girl?

401
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,999
Depends who's asking.

402
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,439
Hmm, I'm just trying to place you.

403
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,320
Maybe we knew you
when you was a kiddie.

404
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
Did you live in Madeira Gardens?

405
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,879
I'm looking at you and it's...

406
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,880
..it's like I'm getting...
hair ribbons? Give over, Mum.

407
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,519
I see congratulations
are in order for you, too.

408
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,959
How long you been married?

409
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
Antoinette Douglas.

410
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Douglas! I knew I knew her.

411
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
You don't forget a child
whose life started off like that.

412
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,639
Poor little scrap.
Poor little scrap?

413
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,879
Mm. She made my life a misery
when I was at St Wilbur's.

414
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,759
She was a snob. And she was a bully.

415
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,759
I'll ignore her when she comes out.

416
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,160
Obviously having that sprog
out of wedlock.

417
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,359
Nothing out of the ordinary here.
Not that there ever is with you.

418
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,319
You're a model mum-to-be.
Oh, I'm an overdue mum-to-be.

419
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,839
Only as of yesterday.
First babies often drag their feet.

420
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,079
Oh, any news of your boyfriend?

421
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,840
No! And there won't be
until his ship comes in.

422
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,800
Are you doing all right on your own?

423
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,200
When I'm on my own,
I'm...I'm good at that.

424
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,800
It's just when I go out and about
or when I come here.

425
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,799
There's just such a lot of smiling
faces. I lost my family in the war,

426
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,279
so this kid's not going to be
anybody's grandson or granddaughter.

427
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,759
It's going to be YOUR baby, Toni.

428
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,439
Do you think just having a mum's
going to be enough for it?

429
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,439
Do you know,
you might get a surprise.

430
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,040
I did.

431
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,999
Timothy could be doing that,
Shelagh. I'm sorry,

432
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,240
I've been a little distracted today.
I know.

433
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,599
May's mother sent a parcel
from Hong Kong! What did it contain?

434
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,159
I've hidden it in a drawer. Even
Patrick doesn't know about it. Why?

435
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,999
Last Christmas,
she didn't send anything.

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,799
Last birthday,
she didn't send anything.

437
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,439
May is perfectly content with that,
and so was I.

438
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,839
But the minute I open that parcel,
the fact that she has a real mother

439
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,399
becomes completely inescapable
again.

440
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,439
The contents of the parcel
may be entirely innocuous.

441
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,080
But you...you must
tell your husband.

442
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,000
No marriage thrives on secrets,
large or small.

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,679
CAT MEOWS
Nothing more today, my friend.

444
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
KNOCK ON DOOR

445
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
It's you again.

446
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,839
CAT MEOWS

447
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,599
Why do you always bring your cat
with you?

448
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,839
It isn't my cat. It just likes me.

449
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,239
I came to wish you
the tidings of the season

450
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,559
and to bring a gift
from the local community.

451
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,280
I can resist many things.
I can do without much.

452
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,359
But a pineapple...a pineapple is
a thing too rare.

453
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I cannot refuse it.

454
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,119
A Victorian Nativity tableau
in a church

455
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,999
seems a most appropriate way to try
to lift our Sister's spirits.

456
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,519
But it would be
a very elaborate enterprise.

457
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,520
A living ox and a living ass?

458
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,479
Very specialised!

459
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,879
And I don't know what the vicar of
St Oswald's will have to say about

460
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,799
animals in church. I told him it's
going to raise money for charity,

461
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,200
which I'm sure can be arranged. With
the assistance of Councillor Buckle?

462
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,959
If you could see the way
Sister Monica Joan's eyes light up

463
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,519
when she talks about her memories,

464
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,279
you wouldn't doubt the value of this
at all.

465
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,679
No-one doubts the value
of making her happy.

466
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,560
It's just that it's a...
a tall order, and at short notice.

467
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,639
Lots of things happen
at short notice.

468
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,999
I mean, what if she's right?
What if this IS her last Christmas?

469
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,919
What if we don't try and make her
happy while we've got the chance?

470
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
PHONE RINGS

471
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,039
PIPS BEEP
NURSE CRANE: Sister Julienne!

472
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,719
I've been having some further
thoughts about the training scheme.

473
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,199
Regarding the role of the enema,

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,279
why it has fallen so far
out of favour and what we can do

475
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,879
to reinforce the practice
with our students.

476
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,399
We can discuss all that
once you come home.

477
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,279
In the meanwhile,
I have a commission for you.

478
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,159
A knitted Christmas stocking,
Victorian style.

479
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,999
What...what sort of size?

480
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,319
Big enough to take a ragdoll, an
orange and a Book Of Common Prayer.

481
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,800
We are planning something
rather special.

482
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,919
When I first came here,
the only pineapple was in tins.

483
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,839
And tins were only possible
if you had connections.

484
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,479
When I first came here, it was
papaya that I missed the most.

485
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
There are too many seeds in papaya.

486
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,359
I brought this for you, Mr Sharma.

487
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,480
You must eat.
You are a guest in my home.

488
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,160
SCUTTLING

489
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,120
I have...other guests.

490
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,999
But these I do not feed.
Mr Sharma, I think I can bring you

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,919
something that would help with
those. I don't want to help them.

492
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,639
I want to kill them.
I have access to chemicals.

493
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,960
I work for the council.
Ah, that I forgot, for a moment.

494
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
Eat, please.

495
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,559
Shelagh, we can seal this up again,

496
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,040
but we have to open it
in good faith.

497
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,799
May's mother would never
deliberately hurt her.

498
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,279
She might upset her unwittingly.
Well, she might upset me.

499
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,959
She's already upset you. We can
comfort May if she's distressed.

500
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,240
She has a loving home with us.

501
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,159
"To a dear little girl,

502
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,480
"with love at Christmas
from Mama in Hong Kong."

503
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,599
Two kisses.

504
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,079
Oh...

505
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,120
I would have to have
a heart of stone to object to that.

506
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,879
Ahhh!

507
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,640
We can't keep this from her,
Shelagh. I know.

508
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,519
Patrick, this is far too small. It
wouldn't have fitted May a year ago,

509
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,879
and she's grown and grown
in the last six months.

510
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,479
Her mother's not to know that.
What will May think?

511
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,199
That her mother remembered
that it's Christmas

512
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,280
but has forgotten who she is?!

513
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,199
ANDY WILLIAMS: # It's the most
wonderful time of the year

514
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,839
# Ding, dong, ding, dong

515
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,839
# With the kids Jingle-Belling
and everyone telling you

516
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,559
# Be of good cheer... #

517
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,959
LAUGHTER

518
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,159
# It's the most wonderful time
of the year

519
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,919
# Ding, dong, ding, dong

520
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,159
# It's the hap-happiest season
of all

521
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,959
# Ding, dong, ding, dong

522
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,159
# With those holiday greetings

523
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,799
# And gay, happy meetings
When friends come to call... #

524
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,479
She didn't say who acted the angels.

525
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,319
Just that the shepherds were played

526
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,679
by ordinary labourers
from the village

527
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,879
and that Mary and Joseph were
the most recently married couple

528
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,999
from the village. I'm sorry,
but that just sounds daft.

529
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,399
Those are children's parts.
That's what Sister Monica Joan said!

530
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,799
The children only came on
at the end, and she was one of them.

531
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,679
And what were they dressed up as?

532
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,399
Children.

533
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,959
She said they wore ordinary clothes.

534
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,920
Here are some more things
I need you to find out.

535
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,479
# There'll be much mistletoe-ing
And hearts will be glowing

536
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,519
# When loved ones are near

537
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,559
# It's the most wonderful time
of the year! #

538
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,119
MOOING

539
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,199
Oh, and listen, I know the master
of the house is salivating

540
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,599
at the thought of steak tartare, but
in a change to the advertised menu,

541
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,719
we're having cod croquettes.

542
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,239
Geoffrey, I love you so very dearly,
but this really will not do.

543
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,679
Well, you know what I'm like
around blood and meat.

544
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,679
It's not my fault
you married a vampire!

545
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,599
That wasn't what I meant.

546
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,439
Oh, no...

547
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,319
No... I'm in the way, aren't I?
Trying too hard

548
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,639
and ending up a bloody cuckoo
in the nest. No. It's not that.

549
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,599
It IS that. It absolutely is that,
and I ought to know better.

550
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,599
It's just that Matthew's mother's
been so difficult,

551
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,239
and I was so thrilled to see you,
but...

552
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,239
..I'm trying so hard to make
something that's just ours.

553
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,199
Well, I'm not going to have you

554
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,879
jumping through hoops
to please anybody.

555
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,560
You're too good at it, sis. And one
way or another, it will hurt you.

556
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,560
DOOR CRASHES OPEN

557
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,639
Oh! Oh! It's Mrs Douglas, isn't it?

558
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,239
Miss. I felt all right
until about lunchtime,

559
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,479
and now the pains are coming
every five minutes.

560
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,320
SHE GROANS

561
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,439
I can't do this on my own. I can't!

562
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,279
Toni, you don't have to.

563
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,639
And why haven't my waters broken?

564
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,599
Sometimes, waters don't break
until baby's actually born.

565
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,599
But I'll talk you through everything
as it happens.

566
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,279
I'm here, and I will not leave you.

567
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,719
Can I have the big light on?
I never do well in the dark.

568
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,799
A lot of our mothers prefer the
lights low. It helps them to relax.

569
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,200
Well, it's not working with me,
is it?

570
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,440
Your delivery room,
you make the rules.

571
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,279
Now, with your permission,

572
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,959
I'll have a little check
on how things are going.

573
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,199
Will you stop if I have
another pain? Oh, of course!

574
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Now, we can try the gas again,
or you can just breathe through it.

575
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,679
Please, at least stay until morning.

576
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,879
No! Far better that your last
glimpse of your favourite relation

577
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,759
is of him looking wounded but noble

578
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,399
as he walks out into
the desolation of the night.

579
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,319
Where are you going to go, Geoffrey?

580
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,599
A skilled single gentleman always
has two things at his disposal -

581
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,760
a circle of friends...and a plan.

582
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,440
Mwah! I will see you both
during the festive season...

583
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,360
..at some point.

584
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,479
I'd gone down Bethnal Green Tube
with my mum, dad, my baby sister,

585
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,599
my Auntie Pat and my grandma.

586
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,959
The good news is
you're practically fully dilated.

587
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,960
We used to go every night,
before the siren even sounded.

588
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,679
It was a laugh, even an adventure
if you were a kiddie.

589
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,479
Is it all all right? Oh, Baby's
in the most beautiful position.

590
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,240
The head is
just where it ought to be.

591
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,800
I was the only one of us
who made it out alive.

592
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,560
More than 150 people died.
I remember it so vividly.

593
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,840
Are you going to listen
for its heart now? Yes.

594
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,920
I only remember how dark it was...

595
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,919
..and how tight the fireman held me
when he pulled me out.

596
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,119
God, he held me so tight,
I thought he must be a relative,

597
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,200
someone who knew me. But...

598
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,680
..they were all gone.

599
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,560
On nights like that, every child
felt like your own child.

600
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,000
I was taken in and brought up
by my mother's friend.

601
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,799
She said she always wanted
a little one to love.

602
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm not sure she ever knew how.

603
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,560
And then, when I was 16, she died.

604
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,800
When I get to hold this baby...

605
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,119
..it's going to be the first time

606
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,239
that I've touched
my own flesh and blood since then.

607
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,960
I can't wait! I will be
back with you in just a moment.

608
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,479
Daddy, do you think Father Christmas
will bring me a telescope?

609
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,679
Well, you asked him very nicely.

610
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,519
And he must know you'll need one
when Apollo takes off.

611
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,360
PHONE RINGS

612
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,359
Hello? Patrick, I need you here
as soon as possible.

613
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,679
Toni Douglas's baby
is going into distress.

614
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,879
The heartbeat is very irregular,
and as yet I don't know why.

615
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,159
I'm on my way.

616
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,999
TONI GROANS
Toni?

617
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,039
I need you to stay in exactly this
position until Doctor gets here.

618
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,159
Why is the doctor coming?
Is there something wrong?

619
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,279
No. We just need to manage
the way Baby is lying

620
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,519
until it's ready to be born.
Is it to do with why

621
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,239
my waters haven't broken?
DOOR OPENS

622
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,159
Stay exactly as you are.
Do you hear me? Do not move.

623
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,640
TONI GROANS LOUDLY

624
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,999
Her forewaters are still intact,
but I detected a funic souffle

625
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,119
through the Pinard, and I can feel

626
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,199
the cord through the membranes.
TONI GROANS

627
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,919
She's in second stage, fully dilated
and feeling the urge to push.

628
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,639
Is the cord still pulsating?
Yes, but I think it's compressed.

629
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,559
The heartbeat is very erratic.

630
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,759
I can't lose my baby!
And my baby can't lose me!

631
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,159
Toni, that is not going to happen.
We're not going to let that happen.

632
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,799
And I need you to listen to me.
I'm listening. Good girl.

633
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,119
We need you lying on your back...
TONI GROANS

634
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,999
..and we're going to put your feet
into these stirrups.

635
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,080
Episiotomy. Forceps. Now.

636
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,080
Cord's out of the way.

637
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,039
TONI WINCES

638
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,319
I want you to push now. Don't wait
for the pain. Push for your baby.

639
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,239
TONI STRAINS

640
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,319
That's it! Come on!
We can do this if we work together.

641
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
TONI STRAINS

642
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,520
Head's out.

643
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Final push.

644
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,880
TONI STRAINS

645
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,160
BABY CRIES

646
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,279
TONI SOBS

647
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,639
Success!

648
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,520
BABY CRIES

649
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,079
You and I, young man,
nearly had a falling-out.

650
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,399
"Young man"? Is it a boy?

651
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,080
It certainly is!

652
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,520
Well done, Toni!

653
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,440
Hello, son.

654
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
I'm your mummy.

655
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
I don't even know
what that means yet, but...

656
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,079
..it's a start.

657
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,039
LAUGHTER
Morning! I don't suppose

658
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,039
there's any tea left in the pot,
is there?

659
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,839
No Earl Grey,
but a most acceptable Typhoo.

660
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,759
And I even have grapefruit!

661
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,479
I went to the market specially.
The glace cherries were already

662
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,959
in the cupboard. We just had
to blow the dust off the jar.

663
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,239
Are you going to tell her, Sister,
or shall I?

664
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,039
Oh, Mr Franklin will be moving into
Nonnatus House with us

665
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,719
for a few weeks, as a paying guest.

666
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,719
Well, where's he going to sleep?

667
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,039
In the room that once belonged
to Sister Frances.

668
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,759
I was offered your old bed,
but there's still a whiff

669
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,399
of your extra-firm-hold lacquer
in the region of the headboard.

670
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,920
I thought it might keep me awake.
THEY LAUGH

671
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,359
I'll have one reel each
of the crimson, the bottle green

672
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,159
and the primrose.

673
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,639
And a yard of this material.

674
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,799
That's not going to be enough
for a dozen carol singers' capes.

675
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,319
A dozen carol singers' capes?

676
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,559
Well, Sister Veronica said that
you were in charge of them when...

677
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,199
I'm in charge
of the singers' singing,

678
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,399
not their costume!
Oh, can't you help them, Violet?

679
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,079
You're the best needlewoman
in Poplar. Oh!

680
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,919
I'm already running up
or rooting out shepherds' costumes,

681
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,959
Wise Men costumes,
Mary and Joseph costumes.

682
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,400
I'm petrified to pick up the phone!

683
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,079
Mr Robinson, sir? Yes, sir?
The cloth and the disinfectant -

684
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,479
when you have finished,
please may you leave them behind?

685
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,599
Oh, they've done as much good as
they are going to with these walls.

686
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,319
I do not want them for the walls.

687
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,799
I want them for my legs.
What is wrong with your legs?

688
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,520
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

689
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,559
Mr Sharma, are they very painful?

690
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,560
They pain me more now
than they did once.

691
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,559
Me and my house, we're both rotting!

692
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,079
Have you been to the doctor?
It will cost you nothing.

693
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,599
And if you don't want
to go to the surgery,

694
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,279
I can ask the doctor to come here.

695
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,839
I will not see a doctor.
I will not speak to a doctor.

696
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,079
This door, MY door,
is barred to all doctors!

697
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,359
Sister Veronica...

698
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,359
Oh, thank you, dear.

699
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,919
There is no doubt
that this is a lovely,

700
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,199
lovely thing that you're doing
for Sister Monica Joan.

701
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,359
It's perked her up no end,
and she doesn't know about it yet.

702
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,519
She's even gone out
to the shops just now

703
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,159
because she remembered how much
she loved the smell of tangerines.

704
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,079
Yes, but she isn't going to love
any of it if it all falls flat,

705
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,480
and people are going to be asking
for their money back!

706
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,279
I've got carried away,
and now I'm out of my depth.

707
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,919
It reminds me
of when I was in the Guides

708
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,719
and I failed my Life-saving badge!

709
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,519
I got my Life-saving badge.

710
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,919
And mindful of your manifold
and great kindnesses to me,

711
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,599
I would consider it an honour to
jump in and stop you from drowning.

712
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,759
Oh!

713
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,039
Oh, do say yes!

714
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,920
Yes! Please!

715
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,599
Oh!

716
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,839
CHILDREN: Five!

717
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,719
Four! Three!

718
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,679
Two! One!

719
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,719
Blast-off!

720
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,600
THEY SHRIEK HAPPILY

721
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,120
CHEERING

722
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,959
What do you reckon to that, then,
Sister?

723
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,479
I think it is as well they have
done it now and not next year.

724
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,800
I am not displeased
to have witnessed it.

725
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,719
Would this man let ME take a look
at his legs, do you suppose?

726
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,439
He's clearly scared enough
to ask for help.

727
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,919
He's just too scared
to receive it from a doctor.

728
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,559
Mrs Buckle and I have been
making hay at the haberdasher's.

729
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,439
What do you think of these?
Russet brocade for the shepherds,

730
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,239
velvet in mauve and tawny tones
for the magi

731
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,079
and blue for the Virgin Mary,
because who am I to tangle

732
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,719
with two thousand years
of Christian iconography?

733
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,199
Can you actually sew, Mr Franklin?
Trouser buttons are my limit,

734
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,319
but this is all about the vision,
and I have an abundance of that.

735
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,679
Meanwhile, a little bird tells me...

736
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,439
..that you have a knack
with carpentry.

737
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,879
We also need some men of science
to play the magi,

738
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,160
and you got a degree
in civil engineering.

739
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,319
My daughter needs seeing.
Immediately!

740
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,399
She's normally under
top-quality consultants.

741
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,399
Are you in labour, Mrs Shelby?
I just feel like I'm going to burst,

742
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,599
like I'm being blown up and up,
like a bike tyre.

743
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,959
The only shoes she can get on
are her mother's,

744
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,159
and she wears size nines
on account of her bunions.

745
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,600
That's just plain bloody indelicate,
Vincent!

746
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,439
Your ankles are certainly
a little swollen,

747
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,559
but your blood pressure's normal.
Urine's normal.

748
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,159
But I would still like to get you
on the couch and have

749
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,559
a proper feel of your tummy.

750
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,999
I can't. Even if you get me up
there, I won't be able to lie down.

751
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,959
I haven't been able to lie down
for four days.

752
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,560
It's like I'm being smothered
from the inside.

753
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,279
I can't stand another six weeks
of this. Can't you do something?

754
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,839
Brenda is going to spend
the night here with us,

755
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,560
and I am going to speak
to her consultant now.

756
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,119
I shall need to get my tape out
after this, Reggie,

757
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,079
because we need to get you measured
for your shepherd's costume.

758
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,119
I don't want to be a shepherd.

759
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,519
Fred's going to be a shepherd.
You'll both be the same!

760
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,159
I don't like sheep.
I can't stand sheep!

761
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,759
But I'm still going to perform
as a shepherd, without complaint,

762
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,119
because I know it will make
Sister Monica Joan happy.

763
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,360
Well, it will make me unhappy.

764
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,959
You've done well
to get these seen to, Mr Sharma.

765
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,319
Venous ulcers can be quite nasty,
and if they become infected,

766
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,879
they can make you very ill.
If you kindly leave the ointment,

767
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,359
I can keep them clean. Mr Sharma, it
may not be quite as simple as that.

768
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,599
I'm concerned they may be caused
by diabetes.

769
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,959
Do you have any other symptoms,
such as unusual thirst?

770
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,240
I have to get water
from the neighbour.

771
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,359
We're going to get
our heads together

772
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,639
about your living conditions
after Christmas.

773
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,519
Right now, you need blood tests.

774
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,039
I'm going to have to insist
that you see a doctor.

775
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,839
No doctor! No. Not to touch me, not
to persecute me, not to label me!

776
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,199
No lies! No doctor!

777
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,280
This is enough for today.

778
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,399
Timothy, I cannot house a tortoise
on medical premises.

779
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,279
It simply isn't sanitary.
It's from a respectable pet shop.

780
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,999
And Dad said it could just go
under your desk.

781
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,119
Did he indeed? And pray tell,

782
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,679
am I expected to furnish nourishment
and exercise till Christmas?

783
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,119
Tortoises are
exclusively herbivorous

784
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,879
and diurnal, with a tendency
for crepuscular action.

785
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,959
He might just want
to stretch his legs for an hour

786
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,319
before you go home from work.
Oh, good afternoon.

787
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,999
My name is Warwick Mathers.
I'm Mrs Shelby's consultant

788
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,760
at the Royal College Hospital.
Mr Mathers!

789
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,839
Do you want some water, Mr Sharma?
Here, give us here.

790
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,680
I thank you.

791
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,319
Charming little place.

792
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:54,199
And here she is, one of the first
in what we hope will be

793
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,520
a very long line
of fertility-drug success stories!

794
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,119
Hello, Beryl. Are the locals
taking care of you? Yes.

795
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,680
My name's Brenda.

796
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,920
Mr Sharma?

797
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,960
Mr Sharma!

798
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,319
You're right, of course, Turner.

799
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,879
Height of the fundus does suggest
she's now at term.

800
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,680
And polyhydramnios is always a risk
in a twin pregnancy.

801
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,519
There's plenty of water in there,
but not too much.

802
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,599
We had wondered
if it was MORE than twins.

803
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,759
There seems to be a pattern
of higher-order multiples

804
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,079
with fertility drugs.
Oh, don't believe

805
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,639
everything you read in the papers.

806
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,519
Any interest in obstetrics?

807
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,279
Of course, sir. Warm your hands,
and perhaps Mother will let you have

808
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,320
a bash at palpating.

809
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,919
So, start here.

810
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:54,040
And then walk your hands
around the abdomen, like so.

811
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,359
Let's book an ambulance
for tomorrow morning

812
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,879
and get her transferred over to us.

813
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,599
X-ray, bed rest,
continual observation.

814
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,720
This lady is carrying
extremely precious cargo.

815
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
BABY CRIES

816
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,039
I believe you had a hard time.

817
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,719
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

818
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,400
Not even me?

819
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,599
Faggots, mash, gravy, peas

820
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,959
and a piece of your Auntie Glad's
jam roly and evap.

821
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,640
Young mums need to be
properly looked after.

822
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,359
Has he any family you can tell?

823
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,199
I don't really know.
I think he comes from India.

824
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,039
BABY GRIZZLES
It can knock you for six

825
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,679
when your milk first arrives.

826
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,960
My bosoms are like...
bloomin' balloons!

827
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,079
If the baby doesn't suffocate,
he'll drown!

828
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,600
I'll talk you through
the next couple of feeds.

829
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,199
Do you have a name for him yet?

830
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,960
Mark.

831
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,360
His father was called Mitchell,
so...

832
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,520
..I thought an M name would be nice.
Bless you.

833
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,399
There! I think, with some hay
underneath the pillow,

834
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,079
this is going to do
the infant King just fine.

835
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,599
Yeah, but how are we going to
make it look like that golden light

836
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,919
is shining out of him? What's
the phone number for Nonnatus House?

837
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,679
Why do you want to ring
Nonnatus House, Reggie?

838
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,439
It's past everyone's bedtime...
including yours.

839
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,399
I want to talk to Geoffrey.
What about?

840
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,600
I want to tell him
I don't want to be a shepherd.

841
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,839
Reggie, what do you want to be?

842
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,479
An angel.

843
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,719
Angels are played by children,
Reggie.

844
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,759
They were grown-ups in the Bible.

845
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,160
And they've got the best costume.

Can I get you the nurse?

848
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,200
Or a hankie?

849
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,439
You were the one who never had
a hankie when we were at school.

850
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,320
You were the one who never had nits.

851
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,639
I was scratching my head
more often than I wasn't.

852
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
We're that sort of family.

853
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,440
You were all lovely. So lovely.

854
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,599
I used to watch you together,

855
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,159
and all I wanted to do
was be horrible to you.

856
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,199
Tell me I gave as good as I got.
You did all right.

857
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,239
Hmm! I'd have given anything
to have been as loved as you.

858
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,400
Loved?

859
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,519
I hope you're joking.

860
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,720
Spotless hair ribbons looks
a lot like love to a scruffy child.

861
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,840
Clean shoes. The right dinner money.
ANY dinner money!

862
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,159
We were all on free school lunches.

863
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,199
Maybe I looked as though I had it
all, but they were the only things

864
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,279
the woman who brought me up
could give me.

865
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,440
I'm not at my best when I'm jealous.

866
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,480
I had nephews and nieces arriving...

867
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,320
..like rabbits jumping out of hats.

868
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,239
And my lot,

869
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,640
our motto was always
"share all, share small".

870
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:55,199
I kept being passed these babies to
cuddle, and I just couldn't do it.

871
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,639
I still haven't even held one,

872
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,079
not since I was a child myself
and didn't...

873
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,240
..didn't know what it meant
or how much it could hurt you.

874
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,640
Well, you need to get
some practice in, Brenda.

875
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,520
I know I do.

876
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,599
You can try holding Mark.
But only if you want to.

His dad's from Trinidad.

Just get her into the ambulance.
It's barely 30 minutes door to door.

904
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,559
But there's snow on the roads
and more forecast.

00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,639
Listen, Turner, I have no doubt
at all that a normal twin delivery

906
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,319
is entirely within your scope.
But with these twins,

907
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,919
the stakes are far higher.
Send her over now!

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,599
God bless you, love. And thank you
for making my Christmas perfect.

She hasn't had them yet!

I'm afraid we must be on our way.

01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,880
BRENDA GROANS

1014
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,360
BABY CRIES

1015
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,119
You have another little girl,
Brenda!

1016
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,080
And she is pinking to perfection.

1017
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,559
We have heavy blood loss.

1018
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:42,919
No Syntometrine - I can't vouch
for what's going on in there.

1019
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,960
BELLS RING

1020
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,199
Triplets.
Mother in shock, haemorrhage,

1021
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,320
no sign of the placenta.
Let's get this little one inside.

1022
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,840
CAT MEOWS

1023
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,360
DOOR OPENS

1024
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,799
What's the latest?

1025
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,559
All three babies
have made it to the nursery.

1026
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,599
Triplets?!
Brenda's still in theatre.

1027
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,799
She haemorrhaged, and they're having
to remove the placenta manually.

1028
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,400
What's happening?
There was a fourth baby!

1029
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,599
Is that why you wouldn't give
Syntometrine?

1030
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,359
In case there was another baby.

1031
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,359
Has anyone ever had quadruplets
before?

1032
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,120
Yes.
But they've always been so rare.

1033
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,960
Things are going to be different
now science is involved.

1034
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,159
Mr Sharma didn't answer his door.
He might have seen your car

1035
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,799
and think it's an official
visitation. Well, in a way, it is.

1036
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,799
I own that house. When he was still
paying rent, it went into my pocket.

1037
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,599
And now he isn't paying rent,
he's squatting in my property.

1038
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,160
I have to talk to him...

1039
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,439
..find him somewhere else.
He needs one room. One room!

1040
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,919
With water in the taps instead
of on the floor. And a fireplace.

1041
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,480
And an...and an electric light.
It seems so little to ask.

1042
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,320
I don't have as much control
as I once did.

1043
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,359
I'm selling a lot of these buildings
off. Does that grieve you?

1044
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,720
Everything to do with
my father's business grieves me.

1045
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,080
ENGINE STARTS
Wait. Wait.

1046
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:53,319
MATHERS: So, we have Baby A, a boy,
3lb and half an ounce,

1047
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,319
Baby B, a girl, 3lb precisely,

1048
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,439
Baby C, another mademoiselle,

1049
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,519
tipping the scales at 3lb 3,

1050
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,919
and poor little Baby D bringing up
the rear at 2lb 10, a boy.

1051
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,919
He's the only one I haven't seen.

1052
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,559
Are you going to move them
to your hospital? All in good time.

1053
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,879
They're best left undisturbed
until they're stable.

1054
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,879
Our role in the miracle
is, of course, well understood.

1055
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,560
I shall make sure
the press report it correctly.

1056
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,640
Four names! We've going to have
to think of four names, Bren.

1057
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,799
Eight, if we give them middle names,
as well.

1058
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,839
We're going to have to get
another pram!

1059
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,639
We can race each other.

1060
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,960
I'd race you to the end of the world
and back again, Brenda Shelby.

1061
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,400
Drink this. It'll warm you through.

1062
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,440
It was good of your neighbour
to give us some fuel.

1063
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,919
That was almost
a complete white-out.

1064
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,919
I'm surprised you managed
to find your way home at all.

1065
01:06:54,920 --> 01:07:00,439
I was a...a navigator
in the Indian Air Force.

1066
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:04,919
You...develop a memory for routes

1067
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,480
that sits
in the muscle and the bones.

1068
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,080
No! No fire!

1069
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,040
I won't have a fire in here!
I never have a fire in here!

1070
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,960
Put it out. Out!

1071
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,240
I am not cold.
I have trained myself.

1072
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,479
A... A man in the Air Force...

1073
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,560
..can train himself...

1074
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,080
..in anything.

1075
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,240
PHONE RINGS

1076
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,039
Dr Turner's surgery.

1077
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,000
I have completed my last task and
submitted my last written exercise.

1078
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,519
There's a lecture
on new ways of managing

1079
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,039
maternal exhaustion in the morning,
and then I'm on my way home!

1080
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,839
The snow is forecast
to continue intermittently,

1081
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,799
and I confess to being glad
that you winterised your tyres.

1082
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,080
I shall be dandy with my chains on.

1083
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,720
Nearly 200 of us volunteered for
the British RAF when war broke out.

1084
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,360
The King needed us.
The free world needed us.

1085
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,519
It doesn't seem to me that the King
or the free world were...

1086
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,039
..quite as grateful
as they might have been.

1087
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,439
I have my military pension.

1088
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,879
But is it enough
for you to live on, Mr Sharma?

1089
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,679
I had medals, too.

1090
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:44,919
But I sold them.
Why? It was necessary.

1091
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:49,280
I had skills, but they were not
required when I returned to earth.

1092
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,919
I could read maps
and aviation instruments...

1093
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,280
..and the constellations.

1094
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:05,440
But when machines fail, a good
navigator can find his way by stars.

1095
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,879
Every day, I promised God
that no pilot, no plane

1096
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,279
would ever get lost
when I was there to guide the way.

1097
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,120
That is an enormous promise.
It was an enormous war.

1098
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,519
We had hearts like lions.

1099
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,920
You lived a brave life, sir.
You've endured war...

1100
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,239
..and loneliness...

1101
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,839
..and hardship.

1102
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,680
But a man only has so much courage.

1103
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,519
I know he does.

1104
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,640
And minds break, like bodies.

1105
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:49,760
But it is...the body
that will kill you.

1106
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,080
Let us help you, Mr Sharma.

1107
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,440
Let us fetch the doctor.

1108
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:03,239
One final, desperate foray
into yet another public library,

1109
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,439
and a number of mysteries
have been solved.

1110
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,919
The only mystery that I'm interested
in solving is how we're going to get

1111
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,439
all these costumes ready in time
for Christmas Eve!

1112
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,959
At this present moment,
that need not detain us.

1113
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:18,079
Oh! I seem to have identified
the exact Flemish painting

1114
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,119
Sister Monica Joan maintains
the village Nativity was based on.

1115
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,479
It is called
The Adoration Of The Christ Child.

1116
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,439
Artist unknown.

1117
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,719
Fancy that! Yeah.

1118
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,999
You'll have to show Fred and Cyril.
I wanted to show you first

1119
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,240
so you could see the angel
sitting next to Mary.

1120
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,560
And the one standing behind.

1121
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,720
They look like Reggie.

1122
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:54,319
They've got the same thing
that he has. There's no denying it.

1123
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,679
And now there's no denying him.
An angel he will be.

1124
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,719
Shepherds are easy to come by.
God's messengers are not.

1125
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,799
BABY CRIES

1126
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,519
Have you been able
to hold any of the babies yet?

1127
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,199
Erm, I've been allowed to put
my hand through the incubator holes

1128
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,719
and touch them all, apart
from the smallest. It was lovely.

1129
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,239
And when will you be able
to take them home?

1130
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,439
Questions for another day, I think.
Mrs Shelby will be getting tired.

1131
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,240
Thank you. Thanks so much.
Thank you.

1132
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:29,679
Ah, one of our midwife heroines,
unless I'm much mistaken.

1133
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:32,879
Yes. I've already posed
for pictures by the ambulance.

1134
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,160
That's why I'm wearing extra lippy.

1135
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,679
How are you all doing?

1136
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,359
They're all breathing well,
with just some extra oxygen,

1137
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,239
only receiving glucose thus far,
of course,

1138
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,760
but we'll move on to tube feeds
with artificial milk.

1139
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,839
Artificial milk? Mine's come in,
but it won't be enough for them.

1140
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,319
They don't even think there's enough
in the hospital milk bank.

1141
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,720
I might just know a way round that.

1142
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,200
SHE SIGHS

1143
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,000
CRUNCH!
SHE CRIES OUT

1144
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,279
I don't know what hurts more,
my nipples

1145
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,280
or my hand from all that pumping!

1146
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,679
It's going to be less painful
than the engorgement.

1147
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,119
And those quadruplets
are going to do so much better

1148
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,119
having breast milk
through those tubes.

1149
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:29,999
Do you need me to do this every day?

1150
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,079
At least as long
as you're in here with us.

1151
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:36,560
I'm due out on New Year's Eve.
My ten days will be up.

1152
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,400
It'll just be me and him, linking
hands, singing Auld Lang Syne.

1153
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,799
Are you sure this is the only place

1154
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,639
they put the ships
that are due to come in?

1155
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:53,079
It has been the method of record
since the early 19th century.

1156
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,799
I did take the liberty
of telephoning several dockyards,

1157
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,919
but no container ship of that name
is scheduled to arrive.

1158
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,759
It's even possible
no ship of that name exists.

1159
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,959
And no boyfriend, either.

1160
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,799
Or at least, not one that's ever
coming home. I shall go to her flat

1161
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:13,199
and pin a card with our
telephone number on it to the door.

1162
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,640
That way, should he materialise,
he will know where he should come.

1163
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,759
Tell me again
that you're safe to drive.

1164
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,599
I've got a hot-water bottle
against my sacrum,

1165
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,719
I've taken two aspirin
and I'm lathered in Fiery Jack.

1166
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:33,719
Thermos? Full of Nescafe.

1167
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:37,639
Not that I intend to avail myself
of much liquid.

1168
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:41,440
I aim to get home without having
to make a call of nature.

1169
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,000
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

1170
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,079
This is the best picture of you,
the one in the Mirror.

1171
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,959
They caught your good side.
You look like your cousin Dot.

1172
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,719
I would've thought you'd have
more milk than that, Brenda,

1173
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,439
with four of them to fatten up.

1174
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,319
I'm already making
nearly half of what they need!

1175
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,839
And Toni Douglas
is providing loads, as well.

1176
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,239
I'm not sure that's hygienic.
It all gets pasteurised.

1177
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,839
It's perfectly hygienic.
And what's more, it's generous.

1178
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:10,639
God only knows,
she's got little enough in her life

1179
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,399
to share with anybody.
Talk about share all, share small!

1180
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,200
You said she was a bully.
She's a woman now. And so am I.

1181
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,519
Women help each other, Mum.

1182
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,120
Women are family,
even when they're not related.

1183
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,319
After the war, did it never
occur to you to go home?

1184
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,960
My, er, given name means...

1185
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,400
..pride of the community.

1186
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:46,480
My mother selected my name
even before I was born.

1187
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,720
At kindergarten,
I proved it was the proper choice.

1188
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:59,319
At university,
I proved it was the proper choice.

1189
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,919
And when I got
into the Indian Air Force,

1190
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:07,400
she said she wished she had chosen
something even grander.

1191
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,079
And when I volunteered
for the RAF...

1192
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,440
..she didn't say anything at all.

1193
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,200
She could...only cry...

1194
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:28,080
..and kiss my hands. How could
I go back to her afterwards?

1195
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,199
How could I tell her the truth?

1196
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,759
Because a mother will always love
her son, no matter what he does!

1197
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,600
Because she loves me,
she would die of shame.

1198
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:46,479
I was discharged for cowardice.
No! No, there's no such offence.

1199
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,560
There hasn't been any such offence
since World War I!

1200
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,479
The doctors called it by a new name.

1201
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:56,719
They called it
a lack of moral fibre.

1202
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,079
And what sort of doctors were they?

1203
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:05,680
The ones who needed me back in the
air because too many men were dying.

1204
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,879
SHE SIGHS

1205
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,520
What was it that broke you, Kulvir?

1206
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,360
I was in a plane...

1207
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,600
..that limped home on one engine,
trailing smoke.

1208
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:47,039
It crashed on the runway. Above
all the sound of hell and fury,

1209
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,520
I heard the pilot's neck break
when we hit the ground.

1210
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,640
He did not get out.

1211
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,960
I did.

1212
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,199
After they extinguished the fire,

1213
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,399
I saw his body in a barrow.

1214
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,519
It was reduced to coal...

1215
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,440
..no bigger than a dog.

1216
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,560
He could never go home.

1217
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,600
I could never go home.

1218
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,040
I knew then I would never get
in a plane again...

1219
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,039
..not even
if I was court-martialled,

1220
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,560
not even if they put a gun
to my head.

1221
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,599
That's why they diagnosed me
with a lack of moral fibre.

1222
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,320
And that's why
you don't like doctors.

1223
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,440
I would have diagnosed you
as having common sense.

1224
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,839
Mr Sharma, I've been talking
to someone at the British Legion.

1225
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,039
It exists to help ex-servicemen.

1226
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,800
But I am not British.

1227
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,839
You fought for this country.
You were in the RAF.

1228
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,199
And if, by doing that,
you lost everything,

1229
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,959
they can give you something back.

1230
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:07,960
I can find someone to talk to you
about your state of mind.

1231
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,439
Believe me, I know where to look.

1232
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,040
You do?

1233
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,560
I do.

1234
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,079
Your diabetes can be managed,

1235
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,560
and the British Legion
can provide you with a home.

1236
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,760
This is my home.

1237
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,680
And for too long...

1238
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,919
..it is not where I lived...

1239
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,520
..but where I hid.

1240
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,400
There's no need to hide any more,
Mr Sharma.

1241
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,599
Oh! I heard a car.
I thought it was Nurse Crane.

1242
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,319
She's expected back this evening.

1243
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:48,959
Unless she's taken
to travelling round the country

1244
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,439
in a wicker costume hamper,
I'm afraid you're going to be

1245
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,319
sorely disappointed.
"Ealing Studios?" What's all this?

1246
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,119
Capes, bonnets, crinolines
and a selection of Eastern robes.

1247
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:02,119
How on earth did you manage this?
Contacts. Er, contacts, perseverance

1248
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,839
and a very high figure
on the meter of a taxi cab.

1249
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,840
Come on, sis, roll your sleeves up.
I've got four more outside!

1250
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,280
SHE GASPS

1251
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,719
Oh!

1252
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,680
ENGINE STARTS

1253
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,839
I've brought you some cottage pie
with carrots,

1254
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,879
a piece of chocolate sponge.

1255
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,239
Oh, and a coconut. We got one
in our Christmas Club box,

1256
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,799
and no-one in our house
can stand them.

1257
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,639
This is very kind, Mrs Dorrins.

1258
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,480
You're feeding my grandchildren.
The least I can do is feed you.

1259
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:51,159
Got yourself a right little
bobby-dazzler there.

1260
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,559
He's going to be baby Jesus
in a Nativity tomorrow.

1261
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,359
Sister Julienne picked him.

1262
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,719
Oh!

1263
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,239
I don't suppose anyone really knows
WHAT he looked like.

1264
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,439
Either way, this little lad's
going to have a full diary,

1265
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:06,759
because I want the two of you
round at ours

1266
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,760
every Sunday for your dinner.

1267
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,839
These go out
into the boot of the car.

1268
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,519
So we catch the last pick-up
by the North Pole delivery service.

1269
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,759
Then bring that tortoise in.

1270
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,920
And we'll work out how to wrap it!

1271
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,399
I've remade it completely.

1272
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,799
The same collar, the same buttons,
the same belt,

1273
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,839
even quite a lot of the same fabric.

1274
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,439
Just a completely different size.

1275
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,359
Once it's back in the wrapping
with the Hong Kong stamps,

1276
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,919
no-one will ever know.
May will know she's loved.

1277
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,999
And that's because of you
and what you've done.

1278
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,359
Mum! Dad! Sh!
You'll wake the children!

1279
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,200
It's not moving! It's either
hibernating or it's dead.

1280
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,920
SHE GROANS

1281
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,760
Oh...!

1282
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,120
Ah...

1283
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,120
SHE GROANS

1284
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,959
I am not giving that animal
to Teddy on Christmas morning

1285
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,159
unless you are both 100% certain
that it is alive.

1286
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,160
It'll be Genevieve all over again.

1287
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,319
Dead in her hutch,
all three of them hysterical.

1288
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,359
I've always said
the great value of pets

1289
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,639
is they teach children
the rhythms of life and death.

1290
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,559
There's a time and a place, Dad.

1291
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,399
It got too cold
in the boot of the car.

1292
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,399
I'm going to the maternity home
to fetch the heat lamp.

1293
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,080
It's moving!

1294
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,239
He's been! He's been!
Father Christmas has come early!

1295
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:48,159
Woohoo! Er, only animals
get delivered early.

1296
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,160
Nothing else is going to come
till Christmas Day.

1297
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,800
Help...! Oh.

1298
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,640
WEAKLY: Help!

1299
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:08,799
Others have gone to their beds at
my insistence, but I could not rest!

1300
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,800
I can't move, Sister Monica Joan.

1301
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,520
I...I shall summon aid
from those more nimble.

1302
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,880
I have prayed for your return...

1303
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,279
..and you.

1304
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,880
I'll give you eight out of ten.

1305
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:36,759
Halsey House sounds very nice.
And it is by the sea.

1306
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,639
You can come and visit
with your cat.

1307
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:44,079
There are other RAF men there,
the chap from the Legion said.

1308
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,960
I hope I will be good at belonging.

1309
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:52,719
I am no longer accustomed
of doing things with other people.

1310
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:55,199
Do you want to get
a bit of practice in?

1311
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,279
We're short of a learned man
for our Nativity play.

1312
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,199
I think a Nativity play
is a Christian undertaking.

1313
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,960
These men weren't Christian.
But they knew about the stars.

1314
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,119
Oh!

1315
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,479
Oh...

1316
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,480
Any improvements? Any loosening?

1317
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,079
I think I'm in with a chance
of getting off this bed.

1318
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,560
Christmas miracle!
THEY LAUGH

1319
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,999
He looks the part, doesn't he?
He certainly does! Yeah.

1320
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,960
I have a visitor
for Miss Douglas, Sister.

1321
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,880
Mitchell!

1322
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,200
We docked in Liverpool.
I had to hitchhike down.

1323
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,359
Is that...

1324
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,320
..ours?

1325
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,720
It's our son.

1326
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:01,960
A little boy.

1327
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:04,880
Would you like to hold him?

1328
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,639
Yeah!

1329
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,160
MITCHELL CHUCKLES

1330
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,880
Is this his Sunday best?

1331
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,920
Are you ready?

1332
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,079
Baby A.

1333
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,359
Andrew Robin Shelby.

1334
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,679
Baby B?

1335
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,799
Belinda Carol.

1336
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,599
Baby C.

1337
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,439
Christina Holly.

1338
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,039
And Baby D.

1339
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,520
David Noel.

1340
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,160
BABY CRIES

1341
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,559
Happy Christmas, Mum.

1342
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,360
Happy Christmas, Dad.

1343
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,599
You are myself, I think,

1344
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,799
the child I once was,

1345
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,000
whose journey through life was
but...

1346
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,080
..barely commenced.

1347
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:21,840
You have to come with me now.
There's such a lot for you to see.

1348
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,079
HORSE WHINNIES

1349
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:59,399
CHOIR: # It came
upon the midnight clear

1350
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,439
# That glorious song of old

1351
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,159
# From angels bending... #

1352
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,480
MATURE JENNIFER: Sometimes, we only
need a single star to follow -

1353
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,079
one point of light
to unite and guide us,

1354
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:20,800
showing us in the darkness
something greater than ourselves.

1355
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,479
No-one was lost that Christmas,

1356
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,239
for no-one was alone.

1357
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:59,879
And when the children knelt
before the crib,

1358
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,840
each one offered up the thing
that meant the most to them...

1359
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:08,399
..just like the children
from a different time.

1360
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:09,999
A scrapbook.

1361
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,639
A photograph.

1362
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,640
Tortoise!

1363
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,600
And the key to home.

1364
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,119
Giving
need not be costly or elaborate.

1365
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:47,279
But it must be done with joy
and from an open soul,

1366
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,560
for that is the way
our hearts expand and sing.

1367
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:59,639
Sister Monica Joan
dismissed all her talk

1368
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,319
of this being her last Christmas

1369
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,599
and embraced it
as one of her happiest and best,

1370
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,319
observing that the greatest gift
we can receive

1371
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,160
is to be loved and be with others...

1372
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,879
..hand in hand,

1373
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,879
heart-to-heart,

1374
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,640
year after year...

1375
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,360
..until the rockets
cease circling the moon.
