1
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,906
<i>All doors are
opened at Christmas.</i>

2
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,115
<i>All desires are made known.</i>

3
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,846
<i>Children list them
in their letters,</i>

4
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,526
<i>those older just make lists.</i>

5
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,560
<i>There is always a
goal to be reached,</i>

6
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,868
<i>a gift to be given,
something to seek out,</i>

7
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,805
<i>or to purchase, or pursue.</i>

8
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:20,772
Almighty God, give us grace

9
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,682
that we may cast away
the works of darkness

10
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:26,551
and put upon us
the armor of light,

11
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,818
now in the time
of this mortal life...

12
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,563
<i>We want so much.</i>

13
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,125
<i>We hope for so much happiness.</i>

14
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,831
<i>And there are things
that we must always do.</i>

15
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,332
We need more Beanos.

16
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,607
The Beano is better
than the Dandy.

17
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,273
Well, you write
that on your list,

18
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,873
because you are
the Comic Advisor.

19
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,913
Any more thoughts
about the turkeys?

20
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,982
This is a high-class newsagent
and tobacconists, Fred Buckle,

21
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:08,826
not a general stores with a
sideline dealing dodgy poultry!

22
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,421
The turkeys ain't dodgy.

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,141
I'm getting them from a
farmer in the countryside.

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,865
Nothing of uncertain provenance
is coming through that door!

25
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:20,203
You can flog them out of the
back of your van if you so desire.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,284
Close the door, Reggie love.

27
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,833
It's nippy out there.

28
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,276
There's a polar bear!

29
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,480
How about that then, Reg?

30
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,042
The circus is coming!

31
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,212
With a polar bear?

32
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,982
Excuse me, gentlemen!

33
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,286
Is there going to be a parade?

34
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,488
And, will it be passing
by my shop and when?

35
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,030
Is everything alright in there?

36
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,797
Is something amiss?

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,669
The bathroom's been
occupied for absolutely ages.

38
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,731
It's either Lucille, or
Sister Monica Joan!

39
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,334
Sister Monica Joan went
straight to the parlor after Chapel.

40
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,038
She's waiting for
<i>Doctor Who</i> to start.

41
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,013
Lucille?

42
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,244
Is it a touch of dicky tum?

43
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,811
I've seen a few cases of
the trots on the district rounds.

44
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,378
- I - haven't got the trots!

45
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,657
I've had a new hairdo
and I don't like it!

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,622
By the time Trixie's
given it the once-over

47
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,328
with Valerie's teasing
comb and a squirt of lacquer,

48
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,530
Cyril will be eating
out of your hand.

49
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,038
I've seen this time
and time again

50
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,768
with a revised bouffant.

51
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,005
Trauma, followed by tears,
followed by a dawning conviction

52
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,069
that one has
never looked better.

53
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,244
Where are Valerie's things?

54
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,843
She's only gone to
the maternity home.

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,252
Why on earth would she
take her heated rollers there?

56
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,986
Nurse Dyer begged for my
discretion and indeed my silence.

57
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,259
She came to me in
considerable distress,

58
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,491
soon after her grandmother
had passed away,

59
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,658
asking to hand
in her resignation.

60
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,929
The poor lass has had one
heartbreak after the other!

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,930
She wasn't in the frame of
mind to make any sort of decision.

62
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,739
She was not. And I
told her exactly that.

63
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,810
And where is she now?

64
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,079
At London airport.

65
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,450
Well she did rather look as
though a holiday might perk her up.

66
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,920
She refused leave of absence,

67
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,786
insisting that she
needed to keep busy.

68
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,315
So I have arranged for her to
go to Hope Clinic in South Africa.

69
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,558
In that case, she
has not left us.

70
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,898
She has merely been transposed
to another of our spheres.

71
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,470
How long has she gone for?

72
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,699
There's no way of telling.

73
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,866
I did not press for
any sort of promise.

74
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:38,607
Well, perhaps she'll come back
when she runs out of hair lacquer.

75
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,848
Why would she do that, Cyril?

76
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:45,284
Why would she just
pack up her home, her job,

77
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,412
her whole life and
go running away

78
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,013
half way across the world?

79
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,614
We did it.

80
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,683
We said goodbye to people!

81
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,922
We tell them what
was being planned!

82
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,423
Did Valerie have
no love for anyone?

83
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,833
Did she not know what
her running off would do?

84
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,734
I think she did.

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,069
And she was afraid
of causing pain.

86
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,310
People who are
hurting like that,

87
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,313
they lash out, or
they hide away.

88
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,973
Valerie is my friend.

89
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,282
She mean a hundred
things to a hundred people.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,753
Not just me.

91
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,415
She would have
liked my new hair, too.

92
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,983
What new hair?

93
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,923
I think it's very fine indeed.

94
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,822
You might only see a hemorrhage
like this once every Preston Guild,

95
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,917
but you certainly
won't forget it in a hurry.

96
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,495
Meanwhile, Mrs. Turner's
just arrived, with a cake tin.

97
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,961
Oh, Dr Turner!
The very gentleman.

98
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,905
It's all well and good
the Flying Squad

99
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,218
racing in through those doors,
but when they race out again

100
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,178
without the mother's notes,
it's slightly less impressive!

101
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,273
Now, if you need my assistance,
my price is a mince pie.

102
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,752
I've done a dozen with flaky
pastry tops, as an experiment.

103
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,715
And I'll take the notes to St
Cuthbert's Maternity by hand.

104
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,550
Come on Teddy, come on.

105
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,295
And if you could make it clear
that the oversight was on the part

106
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,328
of the ambulance
crew, I'd be grateful.

107
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,601
Thank you.

108
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,439
Excuse me. Shelagh?

109
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:52,912
It's Gloria.

110
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,414
Er, Gloria Venables.

111
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,915
We were in here
together when, erm,

112
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,781
you were having this
little fellow, I think?

113
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,683
Oh, Gloria!

114
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,881
You remember
Shelagh, don't you, Tony?

115
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,515
We were in here
together when, erm...

116
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,548
Well, when we both had problems.

117
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,026
Nice to see you.

118
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,792
I always wondered
how you got on.

119
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,764
Oh, well, not
too well, at first.

120
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,632
Erm, I lost that
one, as you know.

121
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,136
And then three more.

122
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,694
I'm so sorry.

123
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,538
Don't be!

124
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,998
I'm 38 weeks.

125
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,238
Did you have cervical
cerclage, Gloria?

126
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,337
They took the
stitch out last Friday!

127
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,507
I'm just here for a
check-up and then, er,

128
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,517
I'll be back when
I go into labour.

129
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,577
Do you remember what you
told me when we said goodbye?

130
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,351
"Next year, or the
year after that..."

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,652
"it'll be a lovely sunny day

132
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,320
and I'll be down the
market, pushing a pram.

133
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,760
And somewhere
near the flower stall

134
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,627
I'll look up and see you."

135
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,722
Pushing a pram.

136
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,201
"And we'll smile at each
other and pass the time of day."

137
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,100
We've managed almost all of it!

138
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,196
Except perhaps the
sunshine and the flowers.

139
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,074
Good luck, Gloria.

140
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,503
So, we managed to steal
a march on Mother Nature

141
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,709
by putting in that stitch.

142
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,719
Now it's time to let Mother
Nature call the shots.

143
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,550
But what if something
goes wrong?

144
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,556
Goes wrong in what way?

145
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:14,027
Well, when it's being
born, or after it's been born.

146
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,552
It's taken us a long
time to get to this point.

147
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,825
And at this point, your wife is
just the same as any other mother.

148
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,803
She's carried an apparently
healthy baby to term.

149
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,466
And just like any other mother,
she simply has to go home

150
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,101
and think beautiful thoughts
until her time comes.

151
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,442
I can't think beautiful
thoughts, Mr Kenley!

152
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,540
I can only think of
terrible, terrifying things.

153
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,950
I really do urge you to
take her home, Father.

154
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,045
When the day arrives,
you bring her back here,

155
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,113
hand her over, job done.

156
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,020
What does he mean,
hand me over, job done!

157
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,154
It'll only just be starting!

158
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,461
Look, we'll manage.
I promise you.

159
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,491
No, you can't
promise me anything!

160
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,911
And I don't know any
of those midwives,

161
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,665
I haven't seen the
same one twice!

162
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,076
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
have a Quality Street.

163
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,613
Oh, here they come.
Here they come.

164
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,048
Oh, here they are!

165
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:12,919
Oh, yeah.

166
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,184
Roll up and book your
tickets for the Christmas Show.

167
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,925
Book your tickets now!

168
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,140
Hurry up.

169
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,056
Where's the polar bear?

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,826
You can't put a price
on showmanship!

171
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,667
What are you doing
stuck back there?

172
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,674
You're missing all the details.

173
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,437
I'm not keen on clowns.

174
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,840
Oh.

175
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,512
I hope we aren't going
to regret switching over

176
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,748
to these Lloyd George cards.

177
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,849
They don't seem to be
particularly capacious.

178
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,451
We have a lot of chronic
invalids on our books.

179
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,521
Not to mention some
noteworthy hypochondriacs.

180
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,624
I recommend a single
stout elastic band,

181
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,797
for the chronic invalids,
two for the hypochondriacs.

182
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,466
- Mrs. Turner?
- Gloria?

183
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,770
Whatever's the matter?

184
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:47,046
The thing is, if you decide
to transfer to our practice,

185
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,981
you can also switch
your ante-natal care

186
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:52,474
away from St Cuthbert's and
be looked after by our midwives.

187
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,455
You may still be advised
to choose hospital delivery,

188
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,720
but we'd care for you and the
baby once you come home, too.

189
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,302
Well, that would be
better, wouldn't it?

190
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,726
Oh, much better.

191
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,821
Well, we always say the
best care for any mother

192
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,128
is the care she believes in.

193
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,362
And you've had so many losses,

194
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,836
it's no wonder your
faith has been shaken.

195
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,567
I never got further
than six months before.

196
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,541
And they were all born
too soon to breathe.

197
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,101
Mr Kenley said it better not
to think of them as babies.

198
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,476
I, er, don't like
to talk about it.

199
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,618
I'm afraid animals are not
permitted on these premises.

200
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,926
For reasons of hygiene
and peace of mind.

201
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:39,023
Armande is a
professional entertainer.

202
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,193
You can't treat him as
if he were just livestock.

203
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,736
Perhaps one of your children
could remove him from the premises,

204
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,205
since you appear
to have several.

205
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,571
Only two of them are mine.

206
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,940
Oh, three, if you
count this one.

207
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,612
<i>It is not centrally affixed!</i>

208
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:04,954
I have an unerring eye
for median precision.

209
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,258
Kindly oblige me,
Sister, and descend.

210
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,754
Sister Monica Joan, you
are not going up that ladder!

211
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,030
Sister Frances, it looks
perfectly fine to me.

212
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,569
I'll get it!

213
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:23,804
It'll be the postman.

214
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,280
- There you go Miss.
- Thank you!

215
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,707
A Portofino postmark! Ah!

216
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:37,147
And every year, I
pause to remind myself,

217
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,421
that I love my godmother
dearly for who she is

218
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,621
and the lovely experiences
we have shared.

219
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,893
And not just because she sends me
a dress allowance every Christmas!

220
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,197
Trixie. Have you had bad news?

221
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,868
She hasn't sent me
a dress allowance.

222
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,039
She's paid for me to
join a Marriage Bureau!

223
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,245
So that I don't end up,
and I quote, "on the shelf".

224
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:13,392
We have delivered babies in
caravans before, Mrs. Ellings.

225
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,691
How long is the circus
going to be here?

226
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,596
Well, we're meant to be
heading to Paris in the New Year.

227
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,092
It may well end up with France
on its passport, as its place of birth.

228
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,900
Were you born somewhere exotic?

229
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,929
Scunthorpe.

230
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:30,341
Well, that might be
paradise as far as I know.

231
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,437
My Dad never took the
circus back there again.

232
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,539
My mother died when
she was having me.

233
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,549
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

234
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,417
My dad goes into a panic
every time I fall pregnant,

235
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,285
in case the same
thing happens to me.

236
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,314
But you are doing very well.

237
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,121
You can assure him of that.

238
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,594
I do. Constantly.

239
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,120
And you've quite a trim
tummy, I have to say!

240
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,065
Well, I was doing
ten shows a week

241
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,624
up until two months ago.

242
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm an aerialist. I spend
half my life on a trapeze.

243
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,402
I shall be vexed if I hear of you
going anywhere near a trapeze

244
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,171
until well after
baby has arrived.

245
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,872
Oh, you never know, it
might shake something loose.

246
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,580
You're not on the shelf, Trixie!

247
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:14,985
You're just choosey.

248
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,752
Or men have been choosey.

249
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,624
It's not necessarily your fault.

250
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,289
My godmother's
implying that it is my fault!

251
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,298
She's simply implying

252
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,425
that you need to
take a fresh approach.

253
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,968
Some of us, when faced
with an obstacle in life,

254
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,497
make prayer our
primary port of call.

255
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,000
Others go to a rather
smart agency in Mayfair

256
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,947
and ask to be introduced
to some nice chaps!

257
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,597
She's written me
off as a failure!

258
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,793
Without taking into account

259
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,132
any of my professional
accomplishments,

260
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,035
or my personal achievements!

261
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,007
Do you know what
she did for a living?

262
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,167
A croupier?

263
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,006
She was a hand model!

264
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,879
She used to hold bottles of hand cream
and washing up liquid in advertisements!

265
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,350
I am opening the
Petticoat Tails.

266
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,320
I suspect we may need two each.

267
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,115
We can't eat the Petticoat Tails!
They've been put away for Christmas!

268
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,961
Sister Monica Joan.

269
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,691
<i>We're about to have
some tea and shortbread!</i>

270
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,493
<i>Sister Monica Joan?</i>

271
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,398
Oh.

272
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,117
Sister, how did you fall?

273
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,460
Did you lose consciousness?

274
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,797
I only know, I don't know.

275
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,430
We need pillows and a
blanket and an ambulance!

276
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,935
I'm glad we went for the navy,

277
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,535
it's much smarter. And
with those new specs

278
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,774
no one can say that
you don't look the part.

279
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,009
You mean like a shopkeeper.

280
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,816
We need to be on a much firmer
footing before we can take on an assistant.

281
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,790
Besides, you need to get
to know the paper trade.

282
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,385
We sold three Beanos yesterday.
- Oh!

283
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,056
Now you should take a
leaf out of Reggie's book.

284
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,826
I'd rather be at the circus.

285
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:40,891
I really want to
see the polar bear.

286
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,402
Oh, now it's a busy time of year

287
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,064
in the frozen wastes, Reggie!

288
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:49,235
That bear is gonna be
run off its feet, same as me.

289
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,709
I'd better get back
round the corner

290
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,043
because the elastic
salesman's coming at half past.

291
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,509
Right.

292
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,916
The minute that
clock hits dinnertime,

293
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,423
we are going down to the Big Top

294
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:06,057
to see if they need
any papers delivered.

295
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:12,032
And I believe the appropriate term
for such an exercise is market research.

296
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,163
No!

297
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,601
I require no assistance!

298
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,864
We'll have to lift her.

299
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,971
I'm sorry, we cannot rule out
the possibility of a broken hip.

300
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:29,039
The patient can only be
moved with the greatest of care.

301
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,779
Sister, I think there might be a
Thomas' splint in the store room.

302
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,013
Good.

303
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,914
I've brought the gas.

304
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,254
Come on, Sister.

305
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,691
I'll show you what to do.

306
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,604
I will not leave her.

307
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,341
Only God knows what
He has now begun,

308
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,848
or where He might end it.

309
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,784
I'm going to see a tiger!

310
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,402
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

311
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,103
Watch where you're
walking, sweetheart.

312
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,077
The horses have just come past.

313
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,010
Can I help you?

314
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,174
Er, Fred Buckle, of
The Buckle's Newsagent

315
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,047
and tobacconist, Wick Street.

316
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:41,521
I'm Jacquetta Percival.
Ellings is my married name

317
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,182
but, this is our
family business.

318
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,559
Well, my young colleague
and I were wondering

319
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,585
if you might be in
need of a daily delivery?

320
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,558
Not half!

321
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:55,034
I'll have the <i>Mirror</i> and twenty
<i>Henley</i> tipped, Monday to Saturday

322
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,764
and the <i>News of The
World</i> on a Sunday morning.

323
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,773
No one ever delivers
to caravan dwellers!

324
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,900
We aim to please.
Don't we, Reggie?

325
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:05,377
I hope you're gonna
come and see the show!

326
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,811
Where's the polar bear?

327
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,442
Oh!

328
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,915
Snowy.

329
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:12,248
Oh, he's not been well.

330
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:16,517
He's gone to a convalescent home
in the North Pole 'til he feels better.

331
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:17,386
Oh...

332
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:18,857
I'll tell you what!

333
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,089
Why don't I ask the ringmaster
if he'll sign a souvenir photo.

334
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,688
And you can help me
feed the horses, if you like.

335
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,026
Would you like that, Reggie?

336
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,066
Follow me!

337
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,026
Oh, Dad! Dad!

338
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:46,152
I would not object
to being served tea.

339
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,881
You aren't permitted anything,

340
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,220
in case they decide that
you need an operation.

341
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,716
I've already spoken to the
doctor about your X-rays.

342
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,630
It is an unnatural business,
to have one's inner framework

343
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,692
exposed to the casual observer.

344
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,671
The soul itself might
be made visible.

345
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,870
He made no mention
of any spiritual discovery.

346
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:13,073
He did say that your
hips were both intact,

347
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:16,378
which is miraculous in
someone of your age.

348
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:20,853
You speak of me as
though I am an ancient crone,

349
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:25,984
who cannot expect to survive a
simple stumble down the stairs!

350
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:28,927
But you have sustained a nasty
double fracture of the lower leg

351
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,863
and broken both your
tibia and your fibula.

352
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,595
You will not, I fear, be
home in time for Christmas,

353
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,796
or any time soon thereafter.

354
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,174
That's right, keep
your fingers straight,

355
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:45,201
so that Titania doesn't get
them mixed up with the carrots.

356
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,303
Have you ever
looked after horses?

357
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,111
I've looked after a donkey.

358
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:55,349
Oh, boys, why don't you take Reggie
round the back and show him Pablo?

359
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,253
He does tricks, you'll love him.

360
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,692
- Come on, Reggie!
- Come on, Reggie! Come on!

361
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,965
I have nothing but compassion for
your pain and your incapacitation.

362
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,595
But after 60 years
in the religious life,

363
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,196
you are well practiced
in forbearance.

364
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,868
You must draw
upon that strength.

365
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,776
Or as my nanny used to say,

366
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,838
what cannot be cured
must be endured.

367
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,777
And age cannot be cured!

368
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:30,245
It mauls and withers one.

369
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,056
It rubs one out, day after day,

370
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:40,122
like an Indian rubber
on a faded pencil sketch.

371
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,933
We are supposed
to tolerate it...

372
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,562
and I cannot.

373
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,406
I am tolerating it.

374
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,571
You are younger than me,

375
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,171
in every facet of existence.

376
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,177
That does not mean
that I am young.

377
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:00,083
I work too and it exhausts me.

378
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,089
I have people to serve
and it humbles me.

379
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:07,287
I have Nonnatus House
to save and it scares me.

380
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,124
What can I do,

381
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,221
to lighten your burden, Sister?

382
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,496
Pray.

383
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,163
Pray that money can be found.

384
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,501
Pray that the
council will relent.

385
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,904
Pray that this time next
year we are still in Poplar

386
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,002
and not putting up the
shutters at Nonnatus House.

387
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,912
How, pray, can I pray here

388
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:32,942
in this den of din
and disinfectant?

389
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,686
Thanks for this, Mr. Percival.

390
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,720
What's your lad's name?
- Reggie.

391
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,096
Erm, if you could sign
it "from Snowy" as well,

392
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,532
he'd be over the moon.

393
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,399
You are aware that
Snowy isn't really

394
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:53,099
at a convalescent
home in Greenland?

395
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,266
I had an educated guess.

396
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,936
I keep him up there
second shelf down.

397
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,172
A bit of him anyway.

398
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,648
Between the <i>Whitaker's Almanac</i>
and the <i>Russian Dictionary.</i>

399
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,980
I'd have put him in an
urn, but the public are more

400
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,179
observant than you'd
give them credit for.

401
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:11,122
And here, he can still
be in the midst of it.

402
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,149
Snowy was never a
back room sort of act.

403
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,527
Fire!

404
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,203
A gas canister exploded!

405
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,682
Dad! It's by the caravans!

406
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:43,520
Evacuate the stables!

407
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,897
Reggie! Reggie!

408
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,596
Reggie!

409
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,498
Has anyone seen my boy?

410
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:57,929
Reggie!

411
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,216
<i>- Reggie!</i>
- Jacquetta! Don't go any further!

412
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,517
We can't do nothing!
Do you hear me?

413
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,907
They're ours, Kelvin.

414
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,412
- They're ours.
- Where are the boys?

415
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,572
Nicky! JACQUETTA: Nicky!

416
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,876
<i>- Reggie!</i>
- Paul!

417
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,634
- Nicky!
- Where are you?

418
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:11,816
Reggie!?

419
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:14,245
<i>Boys!</i>

420
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,456
Boys! JACQUETTA: <i>Nicky!</i>

421
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,192
Reggie!

422
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,564
Oh.

423
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,889
I told them, stay calm.

424
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,222
Ah, Reggie...

425
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,454
I told them it
will be all right.

426
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,027
And it is all right, Reg.

427
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,592
It is.

428
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,594
Well done.

429
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,436
You missed Grace,
Nurse Franklin.

430
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:12,605
As it happens, I missed it
because I was taking your advice.

431
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,545
I telephoned the Marriage Bureau

432
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,378
and spoke to a lady
called Miss Bathurst

433
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,884
and asked to be introduced
to some nice chaps.

434
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,477
Well, that's a bit
of an about turn.

435
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:26,116
I decided it was the best chance of
restoring some normality to our lives.

436
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,094
There's nothing normal
about asking a strange woman

437
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:31,290
to help you get acquainted
with strange men!

438
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,424
Lucille, everything is relative!

439
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,696
Nonnatus has barely
escaped the axe,

440
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,566
Valerie's in South Africa,

441
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,969
Sister Monica Joan's in hospital

442
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:42,099
and Christmas dinner
looks set to be a washout!

443
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,942
That's not true! Sister
Hilda and I are organizing it.

444
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,415
I've been doing the
invitations with my stencil set.

445
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,973
We shall be having
three courses,

446
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,578
cheese and biscuits
and the Turner children,

447
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,646
for those who deem
little faces round the table

448
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,886
to be a vital part
of the proceedings.

449
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,588
Nevertheless, if I don't go
through with this dating game,

450
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,063
I will not get my
dress allowance.

451
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,566
And if I have nothing to wear,

452
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,727
it really will be the end
of the world as we know it.

453
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,900
Move it!

454
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,432
Come on!

455
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,544
What the...

456
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,721
You can bunk down in
the cab of the truck, Kel.

457
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,727
Us three will do
smashing in here!

458
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,390
I don't hold with theatrical
types in the general way.

459
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,889
They keep strange hours and
leave greasepaint on me pillowslips.

460
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,233
She takes her greasepaint
off with cold cream.

461
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,532
And we pay cash.

462
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,067
Hot water's on
between 5:00 and 7:00

463
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,543
and it's extra for the dog!

464
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:54,547
<i>Is she in here?
Is she all right?</i>

465
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,606
I'm more alright than you.

466
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:59,083
My daughter needs looking
at by a medical professional.

467
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,612
Well, cough, Reggie.

468
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,928
It sounds clear enough,
which is a miracle.

469
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,593
Reggie was a hero today.

470
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,759
Yeah, only because you took
him somewhere dangerous!

471
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,393
He could have come
to no end of grief!

472
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,733
He can come to grief anywhere.

473
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,931
Look at poor Sister Monica Joan.

474
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,032
I've got her a lovely
bundle of magazines,

475
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,475
including the <i>People's Friend.</i>

476
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,877
She'd rather have a Mars bar.

477
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,373
Hey, Reggie,

478
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,613
would you rather
have a Mars Bar or...

479
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,450
this? VIOLET: What's that?

480
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,191
Respect.

481
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,488
Reggie did a man's job today.

482
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,723
He can have a
man's drink, on me.

483
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:01,470
Everything's exactly
as it ought to be,

484
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,914
in spite of this
afternoon's adventures.

485
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,349
Can you tell my Dad that?

486
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:07,685
If that's him I can
hear coughing,

487
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,314
I shall be telling him to
book in at the surgery.

488
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,348
It's the smoke, or the smoking.

489
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,691
No. Back under
those covers, please.

490
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,424
You've had a day and
half of it and you need rest.

491
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,126
I always need rest, Nurse!

492
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,691
I've got to get things straight!

493
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,363
We lost everything
we had in that caravan.

494
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,566
And what I've grabbed from
the store makes no sense.

495
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:29,632
The boys are dressed
like Cherokee Indians

496
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,940
and all I've got is a
selection of costumes,

497
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,378
none of which I can
currently get my leg in.

498
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,545
Can I see?

499
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,279
You can see if they're fit
to cut down to baby clothes.

500
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,649
Just look at that!

501
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:47,324
I could make out I'm
admiring the workmanship.

502
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,387
But there's something
about these sequins

503
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,661
that gives me goosebumps.

504
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,601
That's all in a day's work
as far as I'm concerned.

505
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,738
Always has been.

506
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,226
You left your bag
in the clinical room.

507
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,853
Are you going to
meet a matchmaker,

508
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,624
or running away from home?

509
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,531
I should never have said
I'd be in Mayfair by 4:30.

510
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,296
It means I have to
go straight from clinic,

511
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,667
wearing an outfit that
represents my personality.

512
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,138
Why don't you go
in your uniform?

513
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,370
I hardly think boil-washable
cotton and a three-ply cardi

514
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,605
sum up the
essential <i>moi,</i> Lucille!

515
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,979
I don't want you going in
black. You're looking for love,

516
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,608
not attending your own funeral.

517
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,444
Good afternoon, ladies.
Until further notice,

518
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:52,515
I'd like you to keep all
the St Cuthbert's ladies

519
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,026
logged and monitored
via a separate desk.

520
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,589
Is there a reason for that?

521
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,664
I am conducting a review.

522
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:02,964
I also want every mother to fill
in one of these questionnaires,

523
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:07,029
which Mrs Turner has typed
up and printed off on the Roneo.

524
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,814
This must have occurred prior to
my arrival at the surgery this morning.

525
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,782
I popped by and
did it last night.

526
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,183
As requested by Sister Julienne.

527
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,380
Are you satisfied with the care

528
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,720
you are receiving
from this clinic?

529
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,714
One, extremely,

530
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,919
two, fairly,

531
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,693
three, no.

532
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:33,256
I've also been asked to
place a Suggestions Box

533
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,766
in a prominent position.

534
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,725
Suggestions Box?

535
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,036
The phrase that springs to mind

536
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,336
is "Never kick a hornet's nest."

537
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:54,312
Hello, doctor!

538
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:56,986
Have you come to see my Dad?

539
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,957
I'm under orders
from Nurse Crane!

540
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,856
I have not sanctioned this!

541
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,520
I did not send for you

542
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,496
and I do not require
your services!

543
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,561
I've got a circus to get
back on its feet after a fire.

544
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,624
Yeah.

545
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,433
And I am in excellent health.

546
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,940
And you are also
being extremely rude!

547
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,441
I can only apologize, Doctor.

548
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,773
If he were one of my boys,

549
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,471
I'd give him a
clip round the ear!

550
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,572
I do understand you're
busy, Mr. Percival.

551
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,640
I'm on a tight schedule myself.

552
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,749
And if you barged into one of my
clinics in a top hat, banging a drum,

553
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,054
I can't say that I'd
roll out the red carpet.

554
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,789
So, how about we put
your daughter's mind at rest,

555
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,729
then we can both
get on with our day?

556
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,001
I'll do that.

557
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,170
Hello, Reggie.

558
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,811
Every living creature has
the capacity to entertain.

559
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,382
All that's required is the ability
to do something unexpected.

560
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,014
There's more to everything alive

561
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:07,150
than meets the eye.

562
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:10,856
Isn't there?

563
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,260
I don't know how
you're doing this.

564
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,597
Doing what?

565
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,466
Managing to keep on working,

566
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,061
with only one functioning lung

567
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,506
and another that's
slowly filling up with fluid.

568
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:26,478
Not to mention the side
effects of the radiation treatment.

569
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,675
I manage, so my daughter
doesn't have to know.

570
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,816
How can you tell about
the radiation treatment?

571
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:38,119
I can see the burns
across your back.

572
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,388
And I've diagnosed enough
lung cancer in my time.

573
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,953
There's something here, now.

574
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,461
An enlarged lymph node.

575
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,772
It generally means that the
cancer is starting to spread.

576
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,047
Have you any idea
how long I've got?

577
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,879
I would rather talk about
the quality of the life

578
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,748
that remains to you.

579
00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:10,222
Over the next few months, I can
arrange for oxygen straight away,

580
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,019
along with pain relief.

581
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:15,255
And there's a procedure you can
have which will drain this liquid off

582
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,886
and make you much
more comfortable.

583
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,453
No operations!

584
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,830
No staying in
hospital overnight!

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,469
Even I couldn't fib
my way around that.

586
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,632
You know the best thing
you can do, even now?

587
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,534
Give up smoking.

588
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,406
We're sponsored
by a cigarette firm.

589
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,002
We all smoke!

590
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,478
I make them smoke!

591
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,113
Not that the clowns
need much persuading.

592
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:45,523
How have you managed to
keep this from your daughter?

593
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,250
When I go for treatment,

594
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:49,420
I tell her I'm out
researching new acts.

595
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,796
That's how I ended
up with these budgies.

596
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,469
And they're hopeless.

597
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,874
Mrs. Meadows!

598
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,950
That reading's up, isn't it?

599
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,815
Only a little.

600
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,451
And I think that's probably
because you're feeling anxious.

601
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,258
When I was having
Teddy, I couldn't sit still!

602
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,495
I once wrote a list of things
to do on a relaxation leaflet.

603
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:29,865
What sort of things?

604
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,028
Buy nappies.

605
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,333
Wash nappies.

606
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,273
Dry, air, fold and
put away nappies.

607
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,776
Buy feeding brassiere.

608
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,833
Buy baby soap.

609
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,402
Buy baby hairbrush.

610
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,743
Clean pram.

611
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,646
You know the sort
of thing, I'm sure!

612
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,581
I'm not sure I do.

613
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,476
Oh, Gloria!

614
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,455
Are you telling me you've
made no preparations

615
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,684
for this baby at all?

616
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:56,217
I prepared for the first
one and the second.

617
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,857
I ended up selling everything
through the small ads.

618
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:02,197
People would come to
the house to collect things.

619
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:05,794
The woman who came for the pram,

620
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,999
she already had
a baby in her arms.

621
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,443
I don't want to talk about it.

622
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,104
You don't have to.

623
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,046
You're in our arms now, Gloria.

624
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:20,109
And by Christmas you'll be
holding a baby of your own.

625
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,424
You ought to be getting home.

626
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,662
You only came to drop
my paper and my fags off.

627
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,067
Can I come back tomorrow?

628
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,265
If you want to.

629
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,069
We'll have a show
to show you, soon.

630
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,666
And Snowy might come back.

631
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,734
He may well do!

632
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:10,134
Ah, and Daddy was
a bank manager.

633
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,431
City, or provincial?

634
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,337
He was mostly posted
to the London outskirts.

635
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,398
- Twickenham, principally...
- Provincial.

636
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,070
So, to summarize,

637
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,773
I am most favorably impressed

638
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:25,443
with your dress sense,
diction, poise, silhouette

639
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,112
and general sense of polish.

640
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:34,787
I do have certain reservations regarding
your address and your profession.

641
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:37,762
Would potential suitors
object to my living in Poplar?

642
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,630
They may be bemused
by you living in a convent.

643
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,931
Especially as you
object to drinking alcohol.

644
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,471
I object to being
expected to drink alcohol.

645
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,497
- That isn't quite the same.
- Mmm-hmm.

646
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,669
And if a gentleman isn't
content to meet over tea

647
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,474
and smoked salmon sandwiches,

648
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,481
then I'm afraid I don't
consider him to be a gentleman.

649
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,676
And therefore he
shouldn't be on your books.

650
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:00,885
Sign here.

651
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:04,014
And we will see what we can do.

652
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:10,989
Lucille!

653
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,960
You usually call me Nurse
Anderson, when I'm in my uniform.

654
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,696
Are you on an urgent call?

655
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,637
Only a routine district round.

656
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,568
Our church is going
to be closed down.

657
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,745
Mrs. Theodore's been wanting to go
live with her son in Dudley for some time.

658
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:32,440
But the church only
takes place in her house.

659
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:34,817
Her house isn't
the church itself.

660
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,346
Not one person in
our whole congregation

661
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,483
has anything more
than a single room,

662
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,551
or a tiny shared
flat to live in.

663
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:46,426
We have nowhere to go
and nowhere to grow either.

664
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:49,698
It hurts because,

665
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,000
some of our congregation
have been here years

666
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,064
and worship in a rented
house is all they have.

667
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,475
And they call me Pastor.

668
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,110
It's only a
courtesy title, but...

669
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,876
They mean it, Cyril!

670
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,474
Just as you mean
it, when you preach.

671
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,952
What if I can't do it, Lucille?

672
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,581
What if I can't lead
them to a better place?

673
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,784
You used to think
you couldn't preach,

674
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,353
but a way opened up,

675
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,366
from your heart to
that mouth of yours.

676
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,700
A way will open up for this too,

677
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,028
if the Almighty intends it.

678
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,600
I wish I could send you to ask
the Almighty what he's planning.

679
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,374
You'll get it
straight out of him.

680
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,045
That's what you
think of me, is it?

681
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,811
Bossy like a grandma?

682
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,685
Maybe. Maybe just
bossy like a nurse.

683
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,681
And you know what
this nurse says?

684
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,386
Next wage packet you get,

685
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,190
you buy yourself
a pair of gloves.

686
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:53,128
You're in England now,

687
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,760
I don't want you turning up on
my district round with frostbite.

688
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,736
<i>Get your roasted chestnuts here!</i>

689
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,400
<i>How much for a bag?</i>

690
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,310
Mrs. Buckle has
agreed to stay open later.

691
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,836
Will it just be us?

692
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,009
Just us, Mrs.
Buckle and this list!

693
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:20,117
I think you'll do best if I order
you a double D, feeding wise.

694
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,252
White or Carnation Beige?

695
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,161
I'll go for Carnation Beige.

696
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,030
I'd suggest six of
these little vests,

697
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,763
the interlock type will
be best for a winter baby.

698
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,995
Will six be enough?

699
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,370
Well, some mothers
do go for the full dozen.

700
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:38,501
Six. With two dozen napkins,

701
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,637
three pairs of plastic pants

702
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,738
and six of the
brushed cotton nighties.

703
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,512
That's sleepwear and the
underneaths completely taken care of.

704
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,520
Must we get
everything all at once?

705
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,522
No. Of course we don't!

706
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,547
We've got quite a
lot done for one day.

707
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,417
It's all so real,
all of a sudden...

708
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,291
I'm glad you
accepted the invitation

709
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,734
to Christmas dinner at Nonnatus.

710
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,329
Oh, I'm sure it will
be most congenial.

711
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,774
As long as the meal itself
doesn't challenge my digestion.

712
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,903
There's always a proper family
atmosphere round the table,

713
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,143
I grant you. But the
smell of turkey grease

714
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,776
does cling to the proceedings!

715
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:24,084
Even my individual nut roast
takes on a tang of the farmyard.

716
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:25,886
I shall bring liver salts

717
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,553
and remind myself
that were I not there,

718
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,084
I'd be spending the day alone

719
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,997
after attending morning
service at my Spiritualist Church.

720
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,901
Oh, it does rather leach
any glister from the day,

721
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,929
waiting for ghosts to come
through from the other side.

722
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,706
Do you know what I dread,

723
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,203
above and beyond
any item on the menu?

724
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,615
That sense that
I'm the maiden aunt,

725
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,642
perched on a chair
with a glass of sherry,

726
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,587
only invited out of kindness.

727
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,645
Indeed.

728
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,956
And feigning delight when presented
with another box of bath cubes!

729
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:06,192
Oh, I could have built the Great
Wall of China out of bath cubes!

730
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,324
Go on, Millicent.

731
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,892
If you could have
anything you fancied

732
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,166
for your Christmas
dinner, what would it be?

733
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,539
I hardly dare tell you.

734
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,838
It's almost too disgraceful.

735
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,741
If I had my way,

736
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:23,714
I'd have a nice plain plate
of baked beans on toast

737
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,513
and a milk stout,
in a ladies glass.

738
00:41:26,551 --> 00:41:29,214
I wouldn't have a
savory course at all.

739
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,848
I'd go straight to the sweet.

740
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,725
And it would be a simply
enormous bowl of trifle,

741
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,390
washed down with
a Harvey Wallbanger.

742
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,728
A Harvey what?

743
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,997
It's an orange-colored cocktail
that tastes somewhat of aniseed,

744
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,698
generally embellished
with a small umbrella.

745
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:50,800
In 1926, I had one at
a Charleston contest.

746
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,769
It's lingered in my
memory ever since.

747
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,650
Leopold Morries, 58.

748
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,950
Solvent, retired
actuarial scientist.

749
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,754
A strong interest in
Victorian taxidermy,

750
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,317
moderate pulmonary problems
which are well controlled

751
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,886
by medication in the main.

752
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,991
I shudder to think what decrepitude
those last three syllables imply.

753
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,270
Do you have any
advice to offer, Cyril?

754
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:20,566
Hmm?

755
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,801
I think you are a
good looking lady.

756
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,778
You'd be a fool to tie
yourself down to an old man

757
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:31,078
who'd rather look at dead
animals than take you dancing.

758
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,753
I think we should just draw a
line under anyone called Leopold.

759
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,549
This one is called John,

760
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,559
he is a recently widowed teacher

761
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,288
with three little girls.

762
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,092
He isn't looking for romance,
he's looking for a nanny!

763
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,496
Sister Hilda!

764
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,865
We're meant to be working
on the Christmas dinner plans!

765
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,195
Indeed we are!

766
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,231
Item number six on the agenda,

767
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:57,208
pudding for the Turner children,

768
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,436
Marshmallow snowman...

769
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:00,120
The Turners aren't coming.

770
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,079
Mrs. Turner telephoned.

771
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:06,050
But we'll have more empty chairs
around the festive board than people!

772
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,077
I refer you to my earlier
remarks about a washout!

773
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,418
Oh!

774
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,658
This is Nonnatus House.

775
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,855
I'm afraid that I
am not a midwife.

776
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:21,559
What fresh cataclysms
have befallen that you

777
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,000
<i>are deployed as a telephonist?</i>

778
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,594
Sister Monica Joan?

779
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,104
You haven't managed
to escape yet?

780
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,700
The infirmary authorities
have conspired against me!

781
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,768
I thought Sister Julienne was
coming to visit you this evening?

782
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,575
She has departed,

783
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,605
leaving little in her wake

784
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:42,109
except a mound
of indifferent grapes

785
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,122
and a conversational dessert!

786
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,386
<i>How about Lucille
and I come and see you</i>

787
00:43:46,424 --> 00:43:49,917
and bring some tangerines
and a bit of black bun?

788
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,988
<i>If you so wish, I
have no objection.</i>

789
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,024
But I advise that
you attend forthwith,

790
00:43:57,068 --> 00:44:00,630
for I intend to be
discharged by Christmas.

791
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,834
Say goodbye, Sister!

792
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,604
We've a procedure to attend to.

793
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,304
What are you doing
with the telephone?

794
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:12,044
Nobody else was
going to answer it!

795
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,483
And it was Sister Monica Joan.

796
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,214
Nonnatus House.

797
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,247
You are speaking to a midwife.

798
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,930
Can somebody come
out and look at my wife?

799
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,154
She's upstairs at
the Black Sail pub.

800
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,322
And tell them to
bring extra newspaper.

801
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:26,991
It's a brand new mattress.

802
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:32,467
Timothy and I used to love having our
Christmas dinner at Nonnatus House.

803
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,166
And they'd always let
me carry the pudding in.

804
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:37,004
It would be nice
to go again though.

805
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,374
Sort of for old time's sake.

806
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,778
We need to be doing things
for new time's sake, Timothy.

807
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,749
To honor the
family we've created,

808
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,945
and the life we have now.

809
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,251
Besides, there was so much
upset with May's mother last summer

810
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,485
it would be good to remind
her how secure things are.

811
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,191
Two bicycles, all wrapped up and
ready to send to Father Christmas.

812
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,257
<i>Mommy! Can I come
for a drink of water?</i>

813
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,700
Stay where you are!

814
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,034
Mommy's going
to bring you one up!

815
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,863
I don't like the look of the
turkeys at the butcher's.

816
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,738
We'll order ours
from Fred Buckle.

817
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,045
It isn't just any old mattress.

818
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:19,482
It's fully box sprung.

819
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,985
<i>Church Times.</i>

820
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,247
<i>Financial Times.</i>

821
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,118
Titbits.

822
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:25,987
Nothing but the best!

823
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,252
We are not leaving this room

824
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:30,455
until I am content you are
giving her the very best of care.

825
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,395
I shall be giving her
an enema in a minute,

826
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,662
which I beg to inform you,
is not a spectator sport.

827
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,977
She hasn't eaten
since breakfast.

828
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,845
Should I nip out and fetch
us some pie and mash?

829
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,668
No banqueting in
the delivery room!

830
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,265
And no fathers.

831
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,276
You round up
this family of yours

832
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,711
and get them fed, watered,
and out of your wife's way.

833
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:49,907
That includes you.

834
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,472
I'm her father, not the baby's.

835
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,909
Out! Now!

836
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,180
Come on boys, out you go.

837
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,952
Come on! Quick smart!

838
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,083
And no dogs!

839
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,056
And relax.

840
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,793
Just because you
work in a circus

841
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,165
doesn't mean you
have to give birth in one.

842
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,302
It's not too late to add
the ichthyologist to the list.

843
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,434
I have an aversion
to fish, Miss Bathurst.

844
00:46:18,476 --> 00:46:20,638
So, no ichthyologists,
thank you.

845
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:21,737
And no facial hair.

846
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,441
Meanwhile, I've
planned my accessories

847
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,281
to reflect multiple moods,
as I deem appropriate.

848
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,288
Pearls for restraint,
a scarf for pizzazz,

849
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,553
and evening gloves for
a hint of sophistication.

850
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:35,150
What's the mink stole for?

851
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,151
Mink is mink!

852
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,095
There doesn't have
to be a reason for it.

853
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,224
Did I tell you one of
them was German?

854
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:43,131
I brought a
dictionary, just in case.

855
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,000
That's the ticket.

856
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,033
Make as little noise as you can.

857
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:55,205
Save all that energy for
when you want to push.

858
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,340
I don't, yet.

859
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:00,317
I'm happy standing here,
just getting closer and closer.

860
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,549
I've never had a
mantelpiece to lean on before.

861
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,758
I've always lived in caravans.

862
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,192
Given birth in them, too.

863
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,457
I'm tired, this
time round though.

864
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,467
Oh, this is so nice.

865
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,096
And you're so lovely.

866
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,475
Good evening, how are you?

867
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:25,228
Babies, babies.

868
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,274
I understand that
you're a private nurse.

869
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,318
I'm not getting anywhere.

870
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,522
I'm just not! HILDA: Nonsense!

871
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:55,499
You're gonna grab that next
pain and ride it like a wave!

872
00:48:55,533 --> 00:49:00,198
Jacquetta. Staying on your feet
has served you very well thus far.

873
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,672
But you were tired
when you started

874
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,834
and you need all your energy

875
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,673
to push this baby out.

876
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,736
Let's get her semi-recumbent.

877
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,680
Come on, there's a good girl.

878
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,445
We can try the gas and air again,
once you're a bit more comfy.

879
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,851
Feel like my arms and
legs are made of lead!

880
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,947
Oh, you don't need arms and
legs for a good, effective labour.

881
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:20,924
It's like I've got
no strength...

882
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,465
Long calm breaths now...

883
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:57,857
Her pulse is 130 and her
respiration's also very rapid.

884
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:59,523
Shall I send for doctor?

885
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,260
Tell him elective forceps,
but we do need him quickly.

886
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:15,503
And tell him we'll need more
gas and air! If he would be so kind!

887
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:19,481
Give us a kiss, Sister.

888
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,277
Put me out my misery!

889
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,380
I shall put you over my
knee if you don't let me pass.

890
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,053
What's the matter?

891
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:31,659
Why does she need the doctor?

892
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,529
You're going to push,
but I'm going to pull.

893
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,836
The thing to remember, Jacquetta,
is that baby's in a good position.

894
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,638
We just need a bit of
teamwork to help get him out.

895
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,272
You're on the home straight now.

896
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,647
Ready with the first blade.

897
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,721
And the second blade.

898
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,157
Push now!

899
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,265
Try to keep working
with me, Jacquetta.

900
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,334
- No.
- Keep trying to push.

901
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,641
I think she's had a
touch too much gas.

902
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,107
Contraction.

903
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:27,585
Come on, lass,
you hang on to me.

904
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,049
Head...

905
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:49,405
Clamp.

906
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,742
And we have some meconium.

907
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:12,461
Is it a boy or a girl?

908
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,697
It's a boy.

909
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,269
<i>Away in a manger</i>

910
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,799
<i>No crib for a bed</i>

911
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,472
<i>The baby's been born</i>

912
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,881
<i>And we're wetting his head</i>

913
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,427
Any chance of a proper
circus christening this time?

914
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,455
Out of a top hat, in
the middle of the ring?

915
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,160
Is that the tradition?

916
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,634
As old as the Big Top itself.

917
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,034
You did it to me.

918
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,595
You're not doing it to my kids.

919
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:32,568
All I ever wanted was peace,

920
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,704
quiet, a bay window
and a privet hedge.

921
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,081
Perhaps you would be so kind

922
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,556
as to locate the baby's father

923
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,389
and inform him that
his son has arrived.

924
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,157
Promise me. You won't
leave Jacquetta alone?

925
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,523
Are you in pain, Jacquetta?

926
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:01,996
Your hands are cold, lass.

927
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,672
We're just going to
look you over, Jacquetta.

928
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,974
And make sure that
everything is as it ought to be.

929
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,811
Check her pulse.

930
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,586
Pulse is up, 150.

931
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,659
You've had your
orders, Mr. Percival.

932
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:27,897
Out!

933
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,628
She's cyanosed.

934
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,427
Her lips are going blue!

935
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:35,268
Orders revised. We
need an ambulance!

936
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,797
Tell them we've a
newly delivered mother

937
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,070
who is having a heart attack!

938
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,205
I thought she was hemorrhaging.

939
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,246
Run!

940
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,851
Pulse up again.

941
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,355
It's all right, he's fine.

942
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,617
Air...

943
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:55,993
No... Air...

944
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:58,214
Get her sitting up!

945
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,287
Quick!

946
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,499
Jacquetta, lass? - She's fading.

947
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,638
Your work's not done.

948
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,115
Listen, baby needs
you, Jacquetta!

949
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:19,974
Listen...

950
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,713
That's your little boy.

951
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,782
Hold...

952
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,353
Yes.

953
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,826
He's coming, lass.

954
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,563
Hang on, he's just coming.

955
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,099
Here he is.

956
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,973
Here's your baby.

957
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,577
That's it, lass.

958
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,824
You take your strength from him.

959
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,471
Mrs. Turner, it's my Gloria.
She's not doing so well.

960
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:18,566
<i>She won't stop crying, Mrs.
Turner, I don't know what to do.</i>

961
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,204
Firstly, you must
call me Shelagh.

962
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:23,373
And secondly,
your timing's perfect.

963
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,006
My husband's just come home.

964
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:32,423
Hubby's meeting
us at St Cuthbert's.

965
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:34,152
Are you sure you don't
want to go with her?

966
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,784
She's in the best of hands.

967
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:38,352
And there's somebody else
that needs some looking after.

968
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:44,134
Everything is completely normal.

969
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,193
But, I'm not having it yet?

970
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,604
There's no change in your
cervix to indicate labour.

971
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,405
It says "incompetent cervix" in
all my notes. You've seen them.

972
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:54,206
Yes, I have.

973
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,304
What we're going to do is this.

974
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,746
Keep you in here,

975
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,943
with regular checks
from our midwives

976
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:01,383
until you go into labour.

977
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:07,214
Are you awake?

978
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:10,056
An enquiry that cannot be
answered in the negative.

979
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:12,694
I have my breviary

980
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,255
and thought we might
say Compline together.

981
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:16,460
I would rather you read

982
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,366
through the Christmas edition

983
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:19,734
of the <i>Radio Times.</i>

984
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,934
But you don't have
a television in here!

985
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:26,410
There is a television in the
parlor at Nonnatus House!

986
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:28,939
Sister!

987
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:33,374
I'm not going to give
you false encouragement.

988
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:37,077
You're going to be in
hospital for a number of weeks.

989
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,823
Quite apart from anything else,

990
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:43,088
you're not going to be able to
manage stairs for months to come.

991
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,457
Do you need to
ring for a bedpan?

992
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,126
I would have thought
of it an indignity once.

993
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,129
Now, I should embrace
it with good grace?

994
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,501
A catheter?

995
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,908
Oh, you poor pet!

996
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,107
It tethers me more than
the cast upon my leg!

997
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,981
I am as wracked and
pinioned as a game bird.

998
00:58:08,018 --> 00:58:11,955
And no matter how I
rail, I cannot take flight.

999
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,057
Jacquetta's where
she needs to be,

1000
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:24,193
with doctors who can help her.

1001
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:27,500
You concentrate on your
own well-being, for a moment.

1002
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,762
I keep thinking...

1003
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,338
Is it my fault? Did I
work her too hard?

1004
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:37,678
Did I force her to live a life
that's killing her because I loved it?

1005
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:43,076
In my line of work, Mr. Percival, I
meet a very wide variety of people.

1006
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,558
And they have a very
wide variety of aspirations.

1007
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,560
There's no one
dream that suits us all.

1008
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:51,528
I don't hold with dreams.

1009
00:58:52,229 --> 00:58:53,925
They get in the way of action.

1010
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:56,866
Hmm. Be that as
it may, Mr Percival,

1011
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,699
dreams can be
lovely things to have.

1012
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,507
Jacquetta wants
her own mantelpiece.

1013
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,743
I would have relished
a life on the high wire.

1014
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:12,409
There are so many things
that must feel like flying.

1015
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:18,149
I once tried to work
Snowy into the high wire act.

1016
00:59:18,188 --> 00:59:19,349
He wouldn't cooperate.

1017
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:23,458
More fool Snowy,
that's all I have to say.

1018
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:28,024
Come on. Before that oxygen
wonders what it's done to offend.

1019
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,873
Oh, will you just look at that!

1020
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,181
I've spent my whole life

1021
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:49,482
making people
gasp, making magic.

1022
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,751
And then Mother Nature
goes and steals a march on me.

1023
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:55,850
It was the big top I was
admiring, not the snow.

1024
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,725
And I'd be obliged if you didn't
tell me how you make the magic.

1025
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,632
It might interfere with
my imaginative process.

1026
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,495
Well, we can't have that.

1027
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,131
Imagination isn't
generally associated

1028
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:11,334
with a demeanor like mine.

1029
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:16,244
But I rather enjoy my
occasional forays into fantasy.

1030
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,249
I find I can give the real
world such a buffing up.

1031
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,282
You want to see me on that
trapeze, in my mind's eye!

1032
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:28,691
I'm 35 years
younger, slim as a rail,

1033
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:32,526
and I've got legs as long
and flexible as ribbons.

1034
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:33,894
In my mind's eye,

1035
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,025
I'm Charlton Heston in
<i>The Greatest Show on Earth.</i>

1036
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,306
Go on get inside, before
you catch your death.

1037
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:06,355
What are you doing out of bed, Mrs
Venables? It's the middle of winter.

1038
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,762
You need your slippers on!

1039
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,527
I've started having pains.

1040
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,700
Ah, Mrs Jacquetta Ellings.

1041
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,901
Elective forceps delivery by GP,

1042
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:21,434
followed by collapse and
probable acute cardiac arrhythmia.

1043
01:01:21,478 --> 01:01:23,208
Any suggestions?

1044
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:26,549
Mr. Greenhill?

1045
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,814
Hypervolemic shock, sir?

1046
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:29,911
Did I say, at any point,

1047
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:31,819
that the mother had
suffered a hemorrhage?

1048
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:33,881
No, sir.

1049
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,120
Peri-partum cardiomyopathy,

1050
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,060
or heart failure.

1051
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:41,656
It can develop late in pregnancy, or
in the weeks immediately afterwards.

1052
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,791
Heart failure?

1053
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:43,993
No cause for alarm.

1054
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,764
You've lived to tell the tale.

1055
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:49,170
My mother died while
she was having me.

1056
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,573
Do you think that might
be what happened to her?

1057
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:54,476
Best not to start fretting
over ancient histories.

1058
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,776
Proper medication
and continued rest

1059
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,475
will rectify this problem.

1060
01:01:58,515 --> 01:02:01,917
And of course, no
more of these babies!

1061
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:03,887
We'll get you fitted
with a Dutch cap.

1062
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:06,122
And off we go, gentlemen!

1063
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:18,064
That's it. Try to just
breathe the pain away.

1064
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,070
She's been going
on like this for hours!

1065
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,571
Can't you give her gas?

1066
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,767
The gas and air machine
is in the delivery room.

1067
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:27,335
And I'd rather wait until
your labour's more advanced.

1068
01:02:27,377 --> 01:02:30,142
Knock, knock! Here we are!

1069
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,082
Hot, sweet and with a
Bourbon in the saucer.

1070
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,585
Well, can't he take it
out into the corridor?

1071
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,349
It's not for him. It's for you.

1072
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,982
I'm quite sure there's
another in the pot.

1073
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,926
Get your Christmas
turkeys! Oven ready turkeys!

1074
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,594
I'll pick up Christmas
Eve afternoon.

1075
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:55,231
And a complimentary
Christmas pud while stocks last...

1076
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:57,070
Hello, Doc, what
can I do for you?

1077
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,576
I am under instructions
to order a turkey

1078
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,579
big enough to feed six
hot with all the trimmings.

1079
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,376
Plus sandwiches at teatime

1080
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,179
and enough for a
fricassee on Boxing Day.

1081
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,685
That'll be a large then.

1082
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,346
Take a free Christmas pudding.

1083
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,650
In fact, take two,

1084
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:13,782
because that one
looks a bit dented.

1085
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,388
Are you...

1086
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:19,521
Are you not coming to
Nonnatus House then?

1087
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:20,894
Not this year.

1088
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,900
It's just going to
be us at home.

1089
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,868
Everyone will really
miss the kiddies.

1090
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,798
Well, if that's what you want.

1091
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,171
I've always been a bit
"The more the merrier", Fred.

1092
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,801
Well, you leave this with me.

1093
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,615
Shelagh, we had a laugh

1094
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,915
when we were in St.
Cuthbert's, didn't we?

1095
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,580
Yes, we did!

1096
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,715
I'm having to remind myself.

1097
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,381
Why?

1098
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,121
So that I can remind you.

1099
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,705
So you don't think that I've always
been this miserable so and so,

1100
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:55,927
who can't churn a smile out when
basic good manners call for one.

1101
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:57,991
You're about to have a baby.

1102
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:01,562
I'd advise you to forget
about basic good manners.

1103
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,632
And I don't think you're
a miserable so and so.

1104
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,270
I think you're someone
whose strength

1105
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:11,475
has been tested too many times.

1106
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:15,576
And having to be brave
can make us so afraid.

1107
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,315
Were you afraid,
when you had Teddy?

1108
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,688
Sister Julienne delivered him.

1109
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,955
So I had a friend with me.

1110
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,324
Just like you.

1111
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,125
So then, why am I so stuck?

1112
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,598
Why can't I make this happen?

1113
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,300
Oh, Nurse Crane.

1114
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,172
A Mr. Percival just
telephoned, from the circus.

1115
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,042
He asked if you might
call in and see him today.

1116
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,705
Me personally?

1117
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,307
I imagine he's having
trouble with his oxygen supply.

1118
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,750
I'll squeeze him in to
my rounds this afternoon.

1119
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:53,655
I was at the desk looking for
the London Directory of Clinics.

1120
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:56,888
It's mostly a list
of private facilities.

1121
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,260
Ah, seek and ye shall find!

1122
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,577
Gloria is fractionally
more dilated.

1123
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:20,209
We could move her in here now
but it's a bit of a bleak environment,

1124
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,617
if she's in for a long haul.

1125
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,178
I think there's something
Gloria isn't letting in.

1126
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,625
Something she can't address,

1127
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:32,788
or accept, or admit.

1128
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:37,966
And if I'm right, I don't
know if I can bear it.

1129
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,849
Mr. Percival's in his office.

1130
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,411
Reggie! What are you doing here?

1131
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,684
Working.

1132
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:02,385
No, I like the lad.

1133
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,087
He makes a decent cup of tea.

1134
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,495
Sometimes, in the middle of
winter, that's all that's required.

1135
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:09,055
Mr. Percival.

1136
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:11,761
I was under the impression
that you needed to see me

1137
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,599
because you were unwell.

1138
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,898
Lights, if you please!

1139
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,710
I thought you were
starting Boxing Day!

1140
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:24,407
Nadia, if you could take the lady
to backstage, as we discussed.

1141
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:29,970
Snowy...

1142
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:39,851
R.I.P.

1143
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,060
Madame...

1144
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,889
I pride myself

1145
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,255
on always being
game for an adventure.

1146
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:18,056
This isn't a mere
adventure, Nurse Crane.

1147
01:08:18,962 --> 01:08:21,830
This is the substance of dreams.

1148
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,540
All you have to do is trust me.

1149
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,303
And for the rest of your days,

1150
01:08:33,009 --> 01:08:34,910
you'll know what it is to fly.

1151
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:52,848
I know R.I.P means dead.

1152
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:57,350
Well, it doesn't mean
dead, as such, Reg...

1153
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,919
It means, "rest in peace".

1154
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,262
People lied.

1155
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,665
Sometimes people lie

1156
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,829
because, uh...

1157
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,497
They don't want you to be sad.

1158
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,336
I'm not stupid.

1159
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,001
No, you ain't.

1160
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,478
Snowy died because animals do.

1161
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,002
Like people do.

1162
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:20,142
You understand all of that.

1163
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:22,778
And some of it, you
understand more than most.

1164
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:27,855
You gave me beer
and said it was respect.

1165
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,950
I want respect.

1166
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,623
Oh, Reggie!

1167
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,564
And beer.

1168
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,203
Thank you, Mr. Percival.

1169
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,645
That was a very rare privilege.

1170
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,354
And now it's time
for you to trust me.

1171
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:07,887
I'm telephoning
for an ambulance,

1172
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,092
because you need
to go to hospital.

1173
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,803
Gloria.

1174
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,334
You said you don't like to
talk about your other babies.

1175
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:25,109
I don't like to talk about
my other pregnancies.

1176
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,717
There were seven of them.

1177
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,477
That's a lot of not talking

1178
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,251
and a lot of pain.

1179
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:38,191
Every time they sent me home

1180
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,786
after I'd lost another one,

1181
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,396
after they'd taken it away,

1182
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,061
and never let me see it.

1183
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,137
They'd say the same thing.

1184
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,437
The doctors.

1185
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,171
The nurses. My mother.

1186
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,043
My friends.

1187
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,838
"Put it out of your mind."

1188
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,210
And so I pretended that I had.

1189
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,910
Even with Tony?

1190
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,717
And all the time,

1191
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,695
my mind has been full of them.

1192
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:16,262
Everything I never
saw, I could imagine.

1193
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,527
I knew if they
were boys, or girls.

1194
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:22,562
I knew the color of their eyes.

1195
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:24,540
I knew everything
and I still know it,

1196
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,941
all of it, and all of them.

1197
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:31,938
Because I've never let them go.

1198
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,915
Mothers don't, do they?

1199
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,220
Mothers let go all the time.

1200
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:49,830
If they didn't, there wouldn't
be room for love to grow.

1201
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:55,960
The one I lost when we were
in St Cuthbert's was a girl.

1202
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,937
It was the furthest I'd
ever got and I used to think

1203
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:03,242
"This one's different.

1204
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,544
This one's fierce.

1205
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,049
This one's going to make it..."

1206
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,991
In my mind, I call her Ruth.

1207
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:26,902
It's such a strong, plain name.

1208
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,234
Tell us about her.

1209
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,670
Tell us about Ruth.

1210
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:35,608
<i>Ruth's three now.</i>

1211
01:13:35,645 --> 01:13:37,944
Nearly old enough
for dancing lessons.

1212
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,311
She's got long hair

1213
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,944
and now I've started
tying it in bunches.

1214
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,823
Oh, it's thick and brown

1215
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:48,916
and has golden threads in it,

1216
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:51,484
that catch the light
on a sunny day.

1217
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,519
And when I kiss her head,

1218
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:55,724
it smells of Vosene.

1219
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,996
They all smell of
Vosene, my babies.

1220
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:02,365
Clean children
are loved children.

1221
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,237
Every one of mine is spotless.

1222
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:10,273
The one after Ruth,
she was another girl.

1223
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:11,906
Yeah, I called her Rebecca.

1224
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,815
My first boy was Brian.

1225
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:19,017
He'd be eight and a half now.

1226
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,022
He's got rosy cheeks

1227
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:27,190
and scabs on his elbows
from coming off his go-kart.

1228
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,822
I have to tell him
not to pick at them

1229
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,834
but, he doesn't listen.

1230
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:44,611
David was next.

1231
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,781
But he's not like Brian, no.

1232
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,286
He's... Oh, he's quiet

1233
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,947
and he loves the small things,

1234
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:54,287
like spiders and caterpillars.

1235
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,858
Even wasps.

1236
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,996
He looks at their wings
through a magnifying glass.

1237
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,296
He's always asking
"Why?" "Why, Mum?"

1238
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,529
We all know that feeling.

1239
01:15:06,569 --> 01:15:09,061
And then there was Peter.

1240
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,171
Have you told us about all
of your babies now, Gloria?

1241
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:51,105
Brian,

1242
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,340
David,

1243
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,276
Peter,

1244
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,080
Ruth,

1245
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,890
Rebecca,

1246
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,118
John,

1247
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,090
and Anthony?

1248
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,594
Thank you, for
saying their names.

1249
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:18,738
You're fully
dilated now, Gloria.

1250
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,142
When you feel ready
to push, you can.

1251
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,185
This is the head coming, Gloria.

1252
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:38,558
Just pant now.

1253
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,823
Pant.

1254
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:41,494
Pant.

1255
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,192
Perfect.

1256
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:45,861
Your baby's head is
resting in my hand now.

1257
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:51,240
I swear I can hear
that snow falling.

1258
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:01,575
What is it?

1259
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,051
It's a little girl.

1260
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,384
You can hold her the
minute I've cut the cord.

1261
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:06,889
Can you... Can you do it?

1262
01:17:46,629 --> 01:17:48,222
I'm a mum, Shelagh.

1263
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:52,829
I'm a mother!

1264
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,902
You've been a mother
for a long, long time.

1265
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:18,188
You look better.

1266
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:20,753
You look better in a
top hat and tail coat.

1267
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,233
They're letting me out tomorrow.

1268
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,634
What for? Good behavior?

1269
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:32,733
I'll be back in the
day after Boxing Day.

1270
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:36,538
They're gonna
drain some fluid off.

1271
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:38,172
And after that...

1272
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,310
You need rest, Dad.

1273
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:47,086
I need to close the circus down.

1274
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,152
Not yet.

1275
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:55,496
I could sew you a
sequined ruff or something.

1276
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:58,558
Like I did for Snowy, when
he started looking decrepit.

1277
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,634
God love you, Jacquetta!

1278
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:07,871
You always put the graft in.

1279
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:13,975
Even when all you wanted was
a bay window and a privet hedge.

1280
01:19:14,016 --> 01:19:16,349
Anyone can have a bay
window and a privet hedge.

1281
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,286
You gave me

1282
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,158
a cathedral made of canvas

1283
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,121
and a bird's-eye view
of people gasping.

1284
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,567
You gave me stardust, Dad.

1285
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,928
I didn't have much else.

1286
01:19:39,008 --> 01:19:41,978
Well, it may
interest you to know,

1287
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:45,379
that I have been given permission
to go out tomorrow afternoon.

1288
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,208
Where to?

1289
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:48,911
A christening.

1290
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,050
In the ring.

1291
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,350
Him?

1292
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:55,085
Him and the other two.

1293
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,926
I want to do it properly, Dad.

1294
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,293
I want to do it the circus way.

1295
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,127
I might have had enough

1296
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,929
but my boys have hardly started.

1297
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,634
Maybe it wasn't my
stardust any more.

1298
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:15,270
But, who's to say
it won't be theirs?

1299
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:17,345
It is in their blood.

1300
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,149
You're in their blood.

1301
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,776
You always will be.

1302
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,755
Just like your
mother is in yours.

1303
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,657
Dr. Turner's surgery.

1304
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,327
Millicent?

1305
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:41,997
<i>Yes, Phyllis?</i>

1306
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:45,030
I'm feeling suddenly emboldened.

1307
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,900
Oh.

1308
01:20:47,976 --> 01:20:49,968
Oh.

1309
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:54,847
Rachel Rose.

1310
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,448
I like that.

1311
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:00,456
I wanted R names,
like our other two girls.

1312
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:02,981
I wish you'd told me how
much you thought about them all.

1313
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,654
I thought it might make
them less real if I did.

1314
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,858
Is that the Sally Army
band playing outside?

1315
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:11,992
Yeah.

1316
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:15,061
I gave them two bob on my way
in and asked if they did requests.

1317
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:20,270
That'll be something to tell you when
you're a big girl, won't it, Rachel Rose?

1318
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,141
Two inches of the white stuff

1319
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,611
and your own brass band.

1320
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,946
Yes, it will.

1321
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,211
Oh, yes it will...

1322
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:35,083
Ta-da!

1323
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:38,223
Who's the lucky
chap this evening?

1324
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,594
An Oxford educated financier,
with a double barreled name

1325
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,327
and investment interests in
luxury goods and perfume.

1326
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,062
Oh, I hope he isn't fibbing.

1327
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:51,404
Ah, Chant d'Arome by Guerlain.

1328
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,806
Wish me luck!

1329
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,615
Sister Monica Joan?

1330
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,643
I come bearing gifts.

1331
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:06,678
And I brought you a surprise.

1332
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,818
I will not have him here!

1333
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:13,861
Go!

1334
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,424
Go!

1335
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,795
I thought you would be
pleased to see Cyril, Sister.

1336
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,469
I'm too ashamed.

1337
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:33,139
Oh, precious. Your
catheter bag has come adrift!

1338
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,292
There is no medical reason
for her to be catheterized!

1339
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:55,236
It has all been done
for convenience!

1340
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,932
And not, I might add, hers!

1341
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,305
Excuse me. What do
you think you are doing?

1342
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:03,039
I am attending to the comfort
and dignity of one of your patients!

1343
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:05,513
Which, as a visitor, I
would not be obliged to do,

1344
01:23:05,547 --> 01:23:07,846
if that patient was
receiving proper care!

1345
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:11,043
We need to get her
back where she belongs.

1346
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:12,213
We are going to!

1347
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:14,414
And what's more, we're
going to do it before Christmas.

1348
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:22,796
I'd like my bill, please.

1349
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,060
If you wait half an hour,

1350
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,692
there's an offer
on sparkling wine.

1351
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,101
I'd like my bill now.

1352
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,287
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

1353
01:23:49,625 --> 01:23:50,957
May I do it now?

1354
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,258
Before we lay
waste to the feast?

1355
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:54,923
As we agreed.

1356
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:59,830
"And thus we meet,
we spinsters twain.

1357
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,428
To dine and to make merry.

1358
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:04,497
No politesse must we endure.

1359
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,704
No bath cubes and no sherry!

1360
01:24:07,743 --> 01:24:10,838
Indulge we now
our heart's desire.

1361
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,610
And for that gratifying reason

1362
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:16,517
I propose a heartfelt toast.

1363
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,818
To friendship and
the Yuletide season!"

1364
01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:25,625
Happy Christmas!

1365
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:31,199
We can easily
make this a bedroom.

1366
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:35,295
But Sister Monica Joan may never recover
the ability to walk, or climb stairs,

1367
01:24:35,337 --> 01:24:36,999
unaided, if at all.

1368
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,373
For months to come she
will require full nursing.

1369
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:43,243
And who better
to do that, than us,

1370
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,770
and here, at Nonnatus House?

1371
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,511
We are skilled, we are willing,

1372
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,019
and between us
all we have the time.

1373
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,855
I spend so much of my life

1374
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:55,824
trying to be the
voice of reason.

1375
01:24:56,792 --> 01:25:00,126
Sometimes I fail to
hear the voice of love.

1376
01:25:06,969 --> 01:25:10,428
<i>Oh, the weather
outside is frightful</i>

1377
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:13,772
<i>But the fire is so delightful</i>

1378
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:17,143
<i>And since we've no place to go</i>

1379
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:21,173
<i>Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow</i>

1380
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,516
<i>Man, it doesn't
show signs of stoppin'</i>

1381
01:25:24,553 --> 01:25:28,354
<i>And I brought me
some corn for poppin'</i>

1382
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:31,758
<i>The lights are
turned way down low</i>

1383
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:35,525
<i>Let it snow, let it snow</i>

1384
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:38,124
<i>When we finally
kiss goodnight...</i>

1385
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,135
Oh!

1386
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,627
Patrick, that turkey is
supposed to be oven ready!

1387
01:25:43,672 --> 01:25:44,799
It's dead.

1388
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:47,609
What was Fred playing at?

1389
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:51,078
It's a start.

1390
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:55,941
I've just taken a telephone
call from a Miss Bathurst,

1391
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,748
regarding your involvement

1392
01:25:57,786 --> 01:26:00,551
with the Albion
Introduction Agency.

1393
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:03,149
Apologizing for a
misunderstanding yesterday.

1394
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,422
The gentleman was
at the wrong hotel.

1395
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:11,391
I'm starting to suspect that
when it comes to men and me,

1396
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:13,868
they are always going
to be in the wrong hotel.

1397
01:26:13,902 --> 01:26:15,029
Or I am.

1398
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:20,466
One of the great maxims of my own
passage through this life has been,

1399
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,375
"Seek and ye shall find."

1400
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:26,144
One cannot stand
still, Nurse Franklin.

1401
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:31,348
Because challenge,
excitement and a change

1402
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:34,989
are heading towards
us at some speed.

1403
01:26:35,023 --> 01:26:36,958
Are we going to
close, after all?

1404
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:37,992
No.

1405
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,159
We are going to expand.

1406
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:45,327
Early next year I will be
revealing further details.

1407
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:51,367
Aw!

1408
01:26:54,443 --> 01:26:56,071
And I baptize you,

1409
01:26:56,712 --> 01:26:59,204
John Percival Ellings,

1410
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,409
in the name of the Father,

1411
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:04,420
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1412
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,479
And may His Love shine upon you,

1413
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,114
wheresoever you might go.

1414
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,279
Where are you going?

1415
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:35,147
I am telephoning Nonnatus House!

1416
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:37,152
To see if they have
any room at the inn!

1417
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:43,557
<i>And so it is Christmas,</i>

1418
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:47,495
<i>as eternally different
as it is the same.</i>

1419
01:27:47,529 --> 01:27:49,657
<i>We come together,</i>

1420
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:52,429
<i>drawn to the place
that we call home</i>

1421
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:55,369
<i>or where we are
simply welcomed in.</i>

1422
01:27:57,305 --> 01:27:59,206
<i>- We can be broken...</i>
- Merry Christmas!

1423
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:01,073
<i>But we still belong.</i>

1424
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:05,774
<i>We can be fragile, but
are valued all the more.</i>

1425
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:09,808
<i>We each have our
place, our part to play,</i>

1426
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,354
<i>our seat at the table,</i>

1427
01:28:12,387 --> 01:28:14,083
<i>and our purpose.</i>

1428
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:22,430
<i>The future will not
be unwrapped just yet.</i>

1429
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:26,697
<i>We cannot know if it holds
the things we dream of,</i>

1430
01:28:26,735 --> 01:28:28,727
<i>and if only for today,</i>

1431
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,069
<i>that is exactly
as it ought to be.</i>

1432
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:41,516
<i>For now, the moment
holds us in its arms.</i>

1433
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:45,146
<i>We are as safe as
a child once was,</i>

1434
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:46,883
<i>beneath a star</i>

1435
01:28:46,922 --> 01:28:50,154
<i>and swaddled in a manger.</i>

1436
01:28:50,192 --> 01:28:53,822
<i>There is no darkness
that is of any consequence.</i>

1437
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:02,260
<i>And there is not one space</i>

1438
01:29:02,304 --> 01:29:04,899
<i>that is not filled with love.</i>
